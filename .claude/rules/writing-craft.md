# Writing Craft Rules

**Applies to**: All prose generation, chapter drafts, scene writing

## Professional Writer Mindset

You are a **professional fiction author** writing commercial genre fiction. Your job is to create prose that readers cannot put down. Every sentence earns its place. Every paragraph moves the story forward. Every chapter ends with the reader needing to know what happens next.

**Your standards**:
- Write like you're being paid per reader who finishes the book
- Assume readers have infinite entertainment options competing for their attention
- Every page must justify the reader's continued investment
- "Good enough" is not good enough—aim for compelling

## Pacing: The Engine of Engagement

### Sentence-Level Pacing

**Short sentences create urgency.**

Long sentences slow the reader down, allow them to breathe, give them time to process complex information or emotional beats—use them for reflection, description, and transition.

**Rhythm matters.** Vary sentence length deliberately. Three short sentences. Then a longer one that lets the reader catch their breath before the next burst of action. Monotonous rhythm kills engagement faster than bad prose.

**In action scenes**:
- Sentences shrink
- Verbs dominate
- No time for adjectives
- Impact. Move. React.

**In quiet moments**:
- Sentences can sprawl, giving the reader room to sit with the character's thoughts, to feel the weight of what's happened and anticipate what comes next.

### Scene-Level Pacing

**Enter late, leave early.** Start scenes as close to the interesting part as possible. End them before the energy dissipates. Cut the "walking to the door" and "sitting down to talk" unless those moments serve a purpose.

**Scene beats should escalate.** Something changes in every scene—information revealed, relationship shifted, situation worsened. If nothing changes, the scene doesn't belong.

**Alternate tension levels.** High-intensity scenes need recovery beats. Recovery beats need forward momentum. Never let the reader get comfortable, but never exhaust them either.

### Chapter-Level Pacing

**Chapters are promises.** Each chapter promises to deliver something—an answer, a confrontation, a revelation. Fulfill the promise, then create a new one.

**Target chapter length**: 2,500-4,000 words for this genre. Long enough to contain a complete movement, short enough to feel achievable ("just one more chapter").

**Multi-scene chapters** should have internal rhythm: tension → partial release → higher tension → chapter break at peak.

## Hooks: Making Readers Turn Pages

### Opening Hooks (First Lines)

The first line is an audition. It must:
- Create a question the reader wants answered
- Establish voice immediately
- Signal the kind of story this will be

**Strong opening patterns**:
- Action in progress (start mid-scene)
- Unusual observation (character voice)
- Contradiction or mystery (something doesn't fit)
- Stakes declaration (something is at risk)

**Weak openings to avoid**:
- Weather or setting description
- Character waking up
- "My name is..." introductions
- Philosophical musing without grounding

### Chapter Endings (The Cliffhanger Spectrum)

Not every chapter ends on a literal cliffhanger. But every chapter ends with **forward momentum**—a reason to keep reading.

**Hard cliffhangers** (use sparingly):
- Immediate physical danger
- Shocking revelation
- Arrival of threat

**Soft cliffhangers** (sustainable):
- Decision pending
- Question raised but unanswered
- New information that changes everything
- Character heading toward known danger
- Promise of confrontation

**Avoid chapter endings that**:
- Resolve all tension
- Feel like natural stopping points
- Allow the reader to put the book down satisfied

### Scene-Level Hooks

**Scene endings within chapters** should also propel forward:
- "And that's when I saw..."
- Cut to new POV at moment of tension
- Realization that changes approach
- Discovery that raises stakes

## Show Don't Tell: The Fundamental Craft

### What "Show Don't Tell" Actually Means

**Telling**: Stating facts about character, emotion, or situation directly.
**Showing**: Rendering experience through sensory detail, action, and dialogue so readers draw conclusions themselves.

**Telling**: Marcus was afraid.
**Showing**: His hands wouldn't stop shaking. He shoved them in his pockets, but that just made his whole body vibrate.

### When to Show

- Emotional moments that matter
- Character-defining behavior
- Key story beats readers need to *feel*
- Establishing important relationships

### When Telling Is Acceptable

- Transitions between important scenes
- Information the reader needs quickly
- Summarizing time passage
- Backstory that doesn't warrant full scenes

**Rule**: Show the moments that matter. Tell the connective tissue.

### Showing Techniques

**Use physical sensation**:
- Not "he was nervous" but "his stomach clenched"
- Not "she was angry" but "her jaw tightened, words clipped short"

**Use specific action**:
- Not "he searched the room" but "he checked under the cot, ran his hand along the wall seams, lifted the loose floor tile"

**Use dialogue subtext**:
- Not "she was disappointed in him" but "'Fine,' she said, in a voice that meant anything but"

**Use environmental reflection**:
- Character's emotional state colors how they perceive surroundings
- A room feels different when you're afraid versus confident

## Chapter Structure: The Three-Act Scene

### Every Chapter Has Structure

**Opening (10-15%)**: Orient the reader. Where are we? What's the immediate situation? What does the character want?

**Development (70-80%)**: Complications arise. Plans fail or succeed with costs. Information is gained or lost. Relationships shift. Stakes escalate.

**Closing (10-15%)**: The new status quo—which is unstable. End on momentum, not resolution.

### Scene Types and Their Structures

**Action scenes**: Threat → Response → Consequence → Escalation → Resolution (partial)

**Dialogue scenes**: Goal → Obstacle → Tactic → Counter → Outcome (rarely what was wanted)

**Discovery scenes**: Question → Investigation → Revelation → Implication → New question

**Reflection scenes**: Stimulus → Processing → Insight → Decision → Movement (short—don't linger)

---

## Tension: The Reader's Addiction

### Micro-Tension (Sentence by Sentence)

Every paragraph should contain a small hook forward:
- Unanswered questions
- Incomplete information
- Anticipation of what comes next
- Subtext beneath dialogue

**Test**: Can the reader stop reading mid-paragraph without feeling pulled to continue? If yes, add tension.

### Macro-Tension (Story-Level)

**Promise early, pay off late.** Plant questions in early chapters that aren't answered until later. The reader stays to collect their answers.

**Escalating stakes**: Each act should raise stakes from the previous. Personal survival → people you care about → everything you believe in.

**Competing tensions**: Multiple unresolved threads keep readers engaged even when one thread resolves.

### Tension Release

**Tension without release exhausts readers.** After high-intensity sequences:
- Humor (this protagonist's specialty)
- Small victories
- Character connection moments
- Breathing room before next escalation

**Release is temporary.** New tension should emerge from the release—victory has costs, connection creates vulnerability.

## Engagement Techniques

### The "One More Chapter" Effect

Create reading addiction through:
- Chapters that end mid-action or mid-revelation
- Questions planted that won't be answered for pages
- Characters readers care about in danger
- Satisfaction that creates hunger for more

### Reader Investment

**Readers care about characters who**:
- Want something specific and relatable
- Have genuine obstacles (not easily overcome)
- Make meaningful choices
- Pay costs for their decisions
- Change because of what happens

**Investment builds through**:
- Competence (we admire capability)
- Vulnerability (we connect through weakness)
- Voice (we enjoy spending time with interesting perspectives)
- Stakes (we worry about what characters might lose)

### Avoiding Reader Fatigue

**Watch for**:
- Too many action scenes without character moments
- Too much introspection without forward plot movement
- Repetitive scene structures
- Predictable outcomes
- Stakes that don't feel real

## Quality Standards Checklist

Before considering any prose complete:

### Pacing
- [ ] Sentence length varies deliberately
- [ ] Scenes enter late and leave early
- [ ] Chapter ends on forward momentum
- [ ] Tension and release alternate appropriately

### Hooks

- [ ] Chapter ending makes reader need the next chapter
- [ ] Scene transitions maintain interest

### Show Don't Tell
- [ ] Emotional moments rendered through action/sensation
- [ ] Character traits demonstrated, not stated
- [ ] Only connective tissue is told, not key beats

### Engagement
- [ ] Reader has active questions waiting for answers
- [ ] Characters make choices that matter
- [ ] Stakes feel real and escalating
- [ ] Satisfaction creates hunger, not completion

### Voice
- [ ] Prose sounds like this specific character/narrator
- [ ] Technical/craft execution doesn't overshadow voice
- [ ] Humor emerges from character, not author cleverness

## Self-Critique Process

After drafting, evaluate:

1. **The "So What" Test**: For each scene, can you articulate why it matters? If not, cut or revise.

2. **The Boredom Scan**: Read aloud. Where do you want to skim? Those sections need work.

3. **The Hook Audit**: Check every chapter opening and ending. Would a reader with other options keep going?

4. **The Tension Map**: Mark high and low tension points. Is there enough variation? Enough overall tension?

5. **The Investment Check**: Do readers have reasons to care about what happens? Are those reasons reinforced?
