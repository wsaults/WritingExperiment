# LitRPG Mechanics Integration Rules

**Applies to**: All prose involving game systems, stats, skills, System messages

## Core Philosophy

LitRPG readers expect mechanical consistency. The game elements are a **feature**, not a distraction. But mechanics serve the story—never let stat blocks interrupt narrative flow.

**Balance principle**: Readers who love crunch can track builds. Readers who don't can skim numbers safely. Both should enjoy the prose.

## System Message Formatting

### Standard Format

```
[Notification Title]
[Content - stats, descriptions, updates]
[Optional: System commentary]
```

**Example**:
```
[Level Up! You are now Level 12!]
[Stat Points Available: 5]
[New Skill Slot Unlocked!]
[Note: The audience was beginning to worry about your progression rate.]
```

### Formatting Rules

- Use square brackets `[ ]` for all System messages
- Title in bold concept (Level Up, Warning, Achievement, etc.)
- Keep stat blocks to 5-6 lines maximum
- System commentary is *rare*—when it appears, it reveals System personality

### In-Line References

For quick mechanical mentions within prose:
- Skill names: Title Case, no brackets: "I activated Resonant Strike"
- Stats: ALL CAPS abbreviation: "My AGI wasn't high enough"
- Levels: Spelled out or numeral depending on context: "Level 12" or "level twelve"
- Damage/numbers: Numerals for specific values: "dealt 247 damage"

## When to Show Full Stats vs. Summarize

### Show Full Stats When:

**Major progression moments**:
- Level-ups
- New skill acquisitions
- Significant stat milestones
- Class evolutions

**First encounters**:
- New enemy types (show their stat block once)
- New item acquisitions (show full description)
- New areas (show environmental notifications)

**Active analysis**:
- Protagonist explicitly examining their build
- Comparing options before a decision
- Teaching another character about mechanics

### Summarize When:

**Combat flow**:
- "My shield absorbed three hits before cracking" (not full shield stats)
- "Stamina dropping fast—maybe thirty seconds left" (not exact percentage)
- "The skill was still on cooldown" (not exact timer)

**Repeated encounters**:
- "Another Gristlemaw, same level as before"
- "The familiar notification popped up"

**Resource management**:
- "Running low on mana" vs. "[Mana: 47/450]"
- "Almost out of healing items" vs. inventory list

**Rule of thumb**: If the exact number matters for what happens next, show it. If only the general state matters, summarize.

## Skill Integration in Prose

### Naming Skills

**First use in a scene**: Full name, brief effect reminder
> I triggered Mana Shield, the barrier flickering to life around me.

**Subsequent uses**: Name only
> Mana Shield caught the blow.

**Casual reference**: Can abbreviate or describe
> I threw up my shield. / The barrier held.

### Describing Skill Effects

**Don't**: Write out mechanical descriptions every time
> I used Resonant Strike, which deals 7% additional damage to enemies already damaged by my attacks, stacking with previous instances.

**Do**: Show the effect in action
> My blade found the same wound I'd opened moments ago. The Resonant Strike bonus made it count—the creature staggered.

### Skill Acquisition Scenes

When learning a new skill, show:
1. The notification (full format)
2. Protagonist's analysis (what it means tactically)
3. Brief consideration of alternatives (if relevant)
4. Decision and immediate reaction

**Example flow**:
```
[New Skill Available: Mana Shield (Active)]
[Cost: 15 MP/second]
[Effect: Barrier absorbs damage equal to INT x 10]

The math worked out to maybe thirty seconds of protection.
That was either a lot or nothing, depending on what was
trying to kill me.

I took it. Defense was overdue.
```

## Stat References in Prose

### When to Reference Stats

**Yes**:
- Explaining why something worked or failed
- Protagonist making build decisions
- Comparing capabilities with others
- Justifying surprising outcomes

**No**:
- Every action in combat
- Routine activities
- Emotional moments (don't break immersion)
- Dialogue (characters don't talk in stat blocks)

### Natural Integration

**Forced**:
> My STR of 18 allowed me to lift the rock.

**Natural**:
> The rock should have been too heavy. Apparently eighteen points of Strength disagreed.

**Forced**:
> With my PER at 22, I noticed the trap.

**Natural**:
> Something about the floor tile looked wrong. High Perception was finally paying off.

## System Personality

The System has a voice: **sardonic, omniscient, occasionally helpful, always watching**.

### System Commentary Guidelines

**Use sparingly**—maybe once per chapter, if that.

**Appropriate moments**:
- After significant achievements (backhanded compliments)
- When protagonist does something unexpected (observer reaction)
- Tutorial moments (dry instruction)
- Deaths/defeats (cold acknowledgment)

**Tone examples**:
- "[Note: That was inadvisable. Proceeding anyway noted.]"
- "[Achievement: Against All Odds - You weren't supposed to survive that.]"
- "[Viewer engagement metrics suggest your near-death was entertaining.]"

**Never**:
- Lengthy explanations
- Emotional support
- Breaking the fourth wall directly
- Contradicting established rules

---

## Combat Mechanics Flow

### The Combat Rhythm

1. **Situation assessment** (can include enemy stat glimpse)
2. **Action** (skill use, attack, movement)
3. **Consequence** (damage dealt/received, resource drain)
4. **Adaptation** (tactical adjustment)
5. **Repeat with escalation**

### Resource Tracking

Readers should always have a general sense of:
- Health status (fine / hurt / critical)
- Mana/Stamina (full / manageable / running out)
- Cooldown states (available / waiting)

**Technique**: Mention resources at scene start, update when they change significantly, remind before critical moments.

### Damage and Injury

**Numbers for impact**:
> The hit registered: 156 damage. More than a quarter of my health, gone.

**Description for immersion**:
> My arm went numb. That wasn't good.

**Best practice**: Combine both
> The hit tore through my shoulder—[Critical Hit: 156 damage]—and suddenly my sword felt very heavy.

## Economy Integration

### Currency References

- Use "UC" (Universal Currency) for standard transactions
- Mention exact amounts for significant purchases
- Round/approximate for casual references

### Item Descriptions

**Full format for new acquisitions**:
```
[Item Acquired: Prismatic Shard]
[Rarity: Rare]
[Effect: Unknown - requires identification]
```

**Brief for routine items**:
> I grabbed the health potion—common tier, nothing special, but it would keep me moving.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Stat dumps**: Don't list all stats unless protagonist is explicitly reviewing them
2. **Mechanic lectures**: Characters don't explain game rules to each other unless teaching
3. **Inconsistent scaling**: Keep damage/health ratios consistent across scenes
4. **Cooldown amnesia**: If a skill has a cooldown, track it
5. **Inventory magic**: Items don't appear without acquisition
6. **Level-inappropriate skills**: Respect progression requirements
