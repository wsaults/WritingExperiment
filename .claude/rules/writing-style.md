# Writing Style Rules

**Applies to**: `universe/style/**/*.md`

## Voice Guide Requirements (`voice-guide.md`)

### Voice Characteristics to Document

1. **Profane but purposeful** - Swearing as punctuation, not filler
2. **Sarcastic observations** - Stated flat, never explained
3. **Self-deprecating humor** - Targets self more than others
4. **Technical analogies** - SWE/robotics metaphors in stress moments
5. **Dark humor as coping** - Escalates with danger level
6. **Occasional vulnerability** - Rare, brief, then controlled

### Required Voice Samples (minimum 15)

**Combat situation** (3 examples)
- Internal monologue during fights
- Show technical analysis + dark humor

**Discovery/exploration** (3 examples)
- Reacting to new information
- Show pattern-recognition thinking

**Social interaction** (3 examples)
- Dealing with allies/enemies
- Show awkwardness + competence mix

**Low moment** (3 examples)

**Victory/success** (3 examples)

Word count: 2,000-3,500 words

## Tone Guide Requirements (`tone-guide.md`)

### The Formula
- 70% action/plot progression
- 20% comedy (integrated, not isolated)
- 10% character/emotional beats

### Action-Comedy Principles
- Comedy enhances action, doesn't interrupt
- Stakes are real, consequences matter
- Humor is character-appropriate, not author-inserted
- Deaths are quick and impactful, not lingered upon
- Victories are satisfying, not undermined by jokes

### Violence Treatment

**DO**:
- Describe combat in tactical terms
- Show consequences (injuries matter)
- Use violence to reveal character
- Make monster deaths more graphic than human deaths

**DON'T**:
- Linger on suffering
- Describe gore for shock value
- Make violence the joke (slapstick death)
- Sanitize consequences

Word count: 1,500-2,500 words
