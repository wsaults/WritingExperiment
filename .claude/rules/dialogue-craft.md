# Dialogue Craft Rules

**Applies to**: All character dialogue, conversations, verbal exchanges

## Core Principle

Every character should be identifiable by their dialogue alone. If you cover the dialogue tags and can't tell who's speaking, the voices aren't distinct enough.

## Voice Differentiation Framework

### The Three Pillars of Distinct Voice

**1. Vocabulary**
- Word choice reflects background, education, culture
- Technical characters use jargon naturally
- Alien species have translation quirks
- Class/status affects formality

**2. Rhythm**
- Sentence length patterns
- Interruption frequency
- Pause usage
- Response speed (quick retorts vs. measured replies)

**3. Perspective**
- What they notice and comment on
- What they assume vs. question
- Their priorities in conversation
- How they process information aloud

## Character Type Templates

### The Protagonist (Marcus Reeves)

**Vocabulary**: Technical metaphors, profanity as punctuation, self-deprecating qualifiers
**Rhythm**: Medium sentences, occasional fragments for emphasis, internal processing shows
**Perspective**: Systems thinking, pattern recognition, sardonic observation

**Example**:
> "That's either a trap or an invitation. Given this dungeon's design philosophy, probably both. With extra trap."

### Human Survivors (Non-Marcus)

Each should have a distinguishing feature:

| Type | Distinguishing Element |
|------|----------------------|
| Military background | Tactical terminology, clipped sentences |
| Medical background | Clinical observations, calm under pressure |
| Academic background | Questions, qualifications, "well, actually" tendency |
| Street survivor | Slang, practical focus, trust issues in speech |
| Former authority | Commands disguised as suggestions, entitlement |

### Alien Species

**General principles**:
- Translation artifacts (slightly formal, occasionally wrong idiom)
- Different conceptual frameworks (time, individuality, death)
- Sensory differences affect descriptions
- Cultural values shape what they consider worth saying

**Specific species patterns**:

| Species | Speech Pattern |
|---------|---------------|
| Velthrani | Formal, superior, lengthy (they have time) |
| Kindari | Precise, pattern-focused, observational |
| Quorathi | Philosophical, question-heavy, indirect |
| Thex Collective | "We" not "I", consensus references, plural thinking |
| Vorrax | Blunt, honor-focused, challenge-oriented |

### The System

**Vocabulary**: Clinical, notification-style, occasionally sardonic
**Rhythm**: Structured, bracketed, information-dense
**Perspective**: Observer, administrator, entertained

**Example**:
> [Note: Your survival continues to exceed statistical projections. This has been flagged as anomalous.]

## Subtext: What's Not Said

### Dialogue Should Operate on Two Levels

**Surface**: What characters literally say
**Subtext**: What they actually mean, want, or feel

**Example**:
> "You should get some rest," she said.

Surface: Health advice
Possible subtext: "I'm worried about you" / "I want you to leave" / "I need time alone" / "You look terrible"

**Context determines subtext.** The same line means different things based on relationship, situation, and delivery.

### Revealing Subtext

**Through action beats**:
> "I'm fine," he said, not meeting her eyes.

**Through word choice**:
> "You should *probably* get some rest." (The qualifier signals uncertainty/suggestion vs. command)

**Through response**:
> "You should get some rest."
> "When you do."
> (Subtext: I won't rest until you do / We're in this together)

### Creating Tension Through Subtext

**Characters who say what they mean** = low tension, high clarity
**Characters who don't say what they mean** = high tension, reader engagement

Mix both. Not every exchange needs hidden meaning, but important conversations should have layers.

## Dialogue Mechanics

### Attribution (Dialogue Tags)

**"Said" is invisible.** Use it freely. Readers skip over it.

**Action beats > fancy tags**:
> "That's insane." Marcus leaned against the wall. "Completely insane."

Better than:
> "That's insane," Marcus exclaimed incredulously.

**Minimize adverbs in tags**:
- "said quietly" → "whispered" or action showing quiet
- "said angrily" → show anger in words/actions
- "said sarcastically" → sarcasm should be obvious from content

### Punctuation and Formatting

**Interrupted dialogue**:
> "I was just—"
> "Don't."

**Trailing off**:
> "I thought maybe we could..."

**Em dashes for sharp interruptions, ellipses for fades.**

**Internal thought during dialogue**:
Use italics sparingly, or integrate into action beats:
> "Of course I trust you," he said. The lie tasted bitter.

### Group Conversations

**Challenge**: Keeping multiple speakers clear

**Techniques**:
- Establish speaking order early
- Give each speaker a physical anchor (where they are)
- Use names in responses when clarifying needed
- Vary response types (question, statement, action, silence)

**Example**:
> Mei spoke first. "We go through the left passage."
>
> "The trapped one?" Jin shook his head. "The right is safer."
>
> "Safer isn't faster." Mei was already moving.
>
> Marcus stayed quiet. They'd figure out he agreed with Jin eventually.

## Alien Dialogue Specifics

### Translation Layer

The protagonist has a translation implant. This means:
- Alien speech comes through as English (to the reader)
- Occasional notes on translation uncertainty
- Idioms that don't quite translate
- Emotional/tonal indicators when body language differs

**Example**:
> "You speak with many edges," the Kindari said. My implant flagged the phrase as [IDIOM: approximate translation—'your words have hidden meanings']

### Non-Human Conceptual Frameworks

**Time perception**:
> "This is urgent."
> "Urgent by your species' measure. Our deliberations will conclude in the appropriate interval."
> By their measure, that could be weeks.

**Individuality**:
> "I will consider your proposal," the Thex said—all three of them speaking in unison, because "I" meant something different when you were a collective.

**Death**:
> "Your mortality makes you hasty," the Velthrani observed. "We have watched species like yours burn through their brief spans, frantic with urgency."

## Dialogue Functions

### Every Conversation Should:

1. **Reveal character** (voice, values, relationships)
2. **Advance plot** (information exchange, decision-making)
3. **Create tension** (conflict, subtext, stakes)
4. **Entertain** (wit, banter, surprise)

Not all four in every exchange, but at least two.

### Dialogue Types

**Confrontation**: Characters with opposing goals
- High tension, direct conflict
- Subtext often becomes text
- Power dynamics visible

**Negotiation**: Characters seeking mutual benefit
- Medium tension, strategic
- Heavy subtext
- Each character has hidden priorities

**Bonding**: Characters building relationship
- Lower tension, character-focused
- Vulnerability possible
- Humor often present

**Exposition**: Information delivery
- Integrate with other types—pure exposition dialogue is boring
- Character reactions to information are as important as information
- Break up with action, response, interpretation

## Common Dialogue Mistakes

1. **"As you know, Bob"**: Characters explaining things they both know for reader benefit
2. **Identical voices**: Everyone sounds like the author
3. **On-the-nose dialogue**: Characters say exactly what they mean/feel
4. **Monologuing**: Long speeches without interruption or reaction
5. **Perfect articulation**: People don't speak in complete, grammatical sentences
6. **Amnesia about relationships**: Characters who've known each other speaking like strangers
