## Brief Background

Jin was closing up his restaurant when the System arrived. He survived the tutorial by hiding effectively and making no aggressive moves. He doesn't have combat instincts, but he has survival instincts—he grew up in post-war South Korea before immigrating, knows what it looks like when the world falls apart.

## Relationship to Protagonist

Jin meets Marcus in the aftermath of the first dungeon. While others are panicking or fighting, Jin is calmly organizing resources, making sure people eat, keeping morale from completely collapsing. Marcus notices him as the only person who seems to have a plan beyond "don't die immediately."

Their relationship is brief (Books 1-2) but significant:
- Jin provides the "voice of experience"—not game experience, but surviving-when-everything-goes-wrong experience
- Jin sees something in Marcus: "You think like my daughter. She's an engineer. Always analyzing. It's a good quality. Don't let it make you forget to feel things."
- Jin reminds Marcus what normal people are like—people who aren't natural combatants or analysts, just people trying to get through the day

## Purpose in Narrative

Jin dies in Book 2 at Victor Reyes's order—not in combat, but executed as a message to Marcus. His death serves multiple functions:
- Establishes that Marcus's choices have consequences for people he cares about
- Demonstrates Victor as a genuine threat, not just a rival
- Gives Marcus a specific loss to carry rather than abstract trauma
- Shows what's at stake: normal good people who deserve to survive

Jin's death is referenced throughout the series whenever Marcus questions whether his approach (cooperation, protection of the weak) is worth the cost.

## Voice Samples

### Voice Characteristics

Jin speaks with quiet authority—not commanding, but grounded. His English is fluent but occasionally formal (learned as a second language). He uses food metaphors naturally, has a habit of turning observations into questions, and delivers wisdom without preaching. When serious, he gets quieter rather than louder.

**Sample 1: First Meeting**

> "You're the one who fixed the water purifier. I watched you work." Jin handed Marcus a bowl of something that smelled like actual food. "Most people here, they run around. Fight. Panic. You sat down and thought first. That's rare."
>
> Marcus took the bowl. "I didn't know what else to do."
>
> "Exactly." Jin smiled, the expression reaching his eyes. "You knew you didn't know. Also rare. Eat. You look like someone who forgets to eat."

**Sample 2: Survival Wisdom**

> "In Korea, after the war, my mother fed the whole street from one pot of soup." Jin stirred the ration stew, somehow making it smell better than it had any right to. "The secret was not the ingredients. The secret was that everyone believed someone was taking care of them. Belief is a nutrient too."
>
> "That's very philosophical for apocalypse cooking."
>
> "Philosophy is what you do when the cooking is boring and the alternative is thinking about dying."

**Sample 3: Advice to Marcus**

> "You think too much." Jin said it gently, like a diagnosis rather than criticism. "This is useful for problems with solutions. But some problems, you survive them. You don't solve them."
>
> "What's the difference?"
>
> Jin considered this. "When my restaurant failed the first time—not the apocalypse, the one before that—I tried to solve it. Worked longer hours. Better menu. More advertising. Still failed." He shrugged. "Second restaurant, I just cooked good food and didn't die. Sometimes survival is enough."
