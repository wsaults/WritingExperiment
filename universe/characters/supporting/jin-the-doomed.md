## Brief Background

Jin was closing up his restaurant when the System arrived. He survived the tutorial by hiding effectively and making no aggressive moves. He doesn't have combat instincts, but he has survival instincts—he grew up in post-war South Korea before immigrating, knows what it looks like when the world falls apart.

## Relationship to Protagonist

Jin meets Marcus in the aftermath of the first dungeon. While others are panicking or fighting, Jin is calmly organizing resources, making sure people eat, keeping morale from completely collapsing. Marcus notices him as the only person who seems to have a plan beyond "don't die immediately."

Their relationship is brief (Books 1-2) but significant:
- Jin provides the "voice of experience"—not game experience, but surviving-when-everything-goes-wrong experience
- Jin sees something in Marcus: "You think like my daughter. She's an engineer. Always analyzing. It's a good quality. Don't let it make you forget to feel things."
- Jin reminds Marcus what normal people are like—people who aren't natural combatants or analysts, just people trying to get through the day

## Purpose in Narrative

Jin dies in Book 2 at Victor Reyes's order—not in combat, but executed as a message to Marcus. His death serves multiple functions:
- Establishes that Marcus's choices have consequences for people he cares about
- Demonstrates Victor as a genuine threat, not just a rival
- Gives Marcus a specific loss to carry rather than abstract trauma
- Shows what's at stake: normal good people who deserve to survive

Jin's death is referenced throughout the series whenever Marcus questions whether his approach (cooperation, protection of the weak) is worth the cost.
