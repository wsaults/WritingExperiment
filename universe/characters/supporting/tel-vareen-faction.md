## Brief Background

Tel'vareen serves as the Liberation Collective's lead advocate in Consortium observer sessions. She's spent centuries arguing for contestant welfare reforms, knowing most proposals will fail but maintaining pressure anyway. The work has hardened her—she's one of the few Kindari who can interact with other species without emotional contamination, though it costs her.

## Relationship to Protagonist

Tel'vareen sees Marcus as both an opportunity and a person—and struggles with the tension. His success could advance Collective goals; his suffering generates the emotional resonance her people feel. She genuinely wants to help him while also knowing she'll use him politically.

Their relationship involves:
- Information about Consortium politics and faction positioning
- Warnings about specific threats from factions hostile to human success
- Requests that Marcus consider his choices' political implications

She's honest about her dual motives, which Marcus appreciates. "I will help you because you deserve help. I will also help you because your survival embarrasses species I dislike. Both of these are true."

What distinguishes Tel'vareen from other Kindari is her ability to compartmentalize—she can care about Marcus as an individual while still viewing him as a political asset. This duality makes her more effective but also more isolated from her own people, who consider such detachment unhealthy.
