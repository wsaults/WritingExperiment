## Brief Background

Rath'veloci pioneered real-time game analysis broadcasts, providing expert commentary on contestant decisions as they happen. Popular with viewers who want to understand *why* contestants succeed or fail. Known for enthusiastic but clinical delivery—he treats contestants as fascinating subjects rather than suffering beings.

## Relationship to Protagonist

Rath'veloci notices Marcus during Book 2 as a statistically anomalous performer. What starts as academic interest (why does this human solve puzzles incorrectly yet successfully?) becomes something closer to investment.

Their relationship works through:
- Official channels: Rath'veloci's public commentary on Marcus's runs, which provides information if Marcus thinks to watch
- Unofficial contact: Brief, deniable communications where Rath'veloci shares insights that technically violate observer neutrality

Rath'veloci never admits to helping Marcus. He frames all assistance as "providing data for research purposes." Whether he's developed actual fondness or is simply invested in his subject's continued existence is left ambiguous.

Sample commentary: "The human has once again selected an approach that, on paper, should fail. Fascinating. Either he possesses information we lack, or his cognitive processes operate on principles we haven't mapped. I find myself... eager... to observe the outcome."

## Purpose in Narrative
