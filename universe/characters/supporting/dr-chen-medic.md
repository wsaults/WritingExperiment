## Brief Background

Dr. Chen survived the tutorial by immediately understanding that healers would always find groups to protect them. She's spent the games building a reputation for competence and neutrality—she'll treat anyone who isn't actively threatening her, which makes her valuable enough that even hostile factions hesitate to target her.

## Relationship to Protagonist

Marcus encounters Dr. Chen when seeking medical attention for his group. Their relationship is professional but warm:
- She treats Marcus's wounds without asking uncomfortable questions
- Provides medical supplies when possible
- Offers the perspective of someone who chose a non-combat survival strategy

Dr. Chen represents the path Marcus didn't take—specializing in making yourself indispensable rather than dangerous. She's not better or worse than his approach, just different. Their conversations often touch on the ethics of survival: what compromises are acceptable, what principles are worth dying for.

"I help everyone. Not because I'm good—because neutrality keeps me alive. If I was selective, I'd be taking sides. Sides get people killed."

Dr. Chen's medical station becomes a recurring location—a place of relative safety where information flows because wounded people talk, and Dr. Chen listens without judgment.
