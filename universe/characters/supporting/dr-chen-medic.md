**Age**: 52
**Role**: Medical expertise; represents the "support class" approach to survival

## Brief Background

Dr. Chen survived the tutorial by immediately understanding that healers would always find groups to protect them. She's spent the games building a reputation for competence and neutrality—she'll treat anyone who isn't actively threatening her, which makes her valuable enough that even hostile factions hesitate to target her.

## Relationship to Protagonist

Marcus encounters Dr. Chen when seeking medical attention for his group. Their relationship is professional but warm:
- She treats Marcus's wounds without asking uncomfortable questions
- Provides medical supplies when possible
- Offers the perspective of someone who chose a non-combat survival strategy

Dr. Chen represents the path Marcus didn't take—specializing in making yourself indispensable rather than dangerous. She's not better or worse than his approach, just different. Their conversations often touch on the ethics of survival: what compromises are acceptable, what principles are worth dying for.

"I help everyone. Not because I'm good—because neutrality keeps me alive. If I was selective, I'd be taking sides. Sides get people killed."

Dr. Chen's medical station becomes a recurring location—a place of relative safety where information flows because wounded people talk, and Dr. Chen listens without judgment.

## Purpose in Narrative

- **Medical support**: Practical resource for healing and medical exposition
- **Alternative model**: Shows survival isn't only about combat capability
- **Ethical sounding board**: Marcus discusses moral questions with someone detached enough to be objective

## Voice Samples

### Voice Characteristics

Dr. Chen speaks with ER efficiency—clear, direct, no wasted words. Uses medical terminology naturally but explains when she notices confusion. Professionally detached but not cold; she cares about patients as a function of competence, not sentiment. Asks questions that sound medical but reveal deeper observation. Dry humor emerges in safe moments. Gets *more* calm as situations get worse.

**Sample 1: First Treatment**

> "Sit. Shirt off. Don't argue—I can see you're favoring your left side from across the room."
>
> Marcus sat. "How did you—"
>
> "Thirty years of watching people pretend they're fine when they're not." She was already examining the wound. "Two broken ribs, one cracked. You've been moving on these for... twelve hours? More?"
>
> "About that."
>
> "Impressive pain tolerance. Stupid decision-making. Both very common in your type." She began applying something that burned. "Your type being 'people who think they're too busy to be injured.'"

**Sample 2: Professional Neutrality**

> "I treated the man who tried to kill you yesterday."
>
> Marcus tensed on the examination table.
>
> "Relax. I'm not going to tell you anything he said, and I'm not going to tell him anything about you. That's how this works." Dr. Chen continued her work without looking up. "I help everyone. Not because I'm a saint—because neutrality is the only thing that keeps me useful enough to protect. The moment I take sides, I become a target instead of a resource."
>
> "That's very... pragmatic."
>
> "I'm alive. Most doctors aren't. Pragmatism has its merits."

**Sample 3: Ethical Sounding Board**

> "You're not here about the shoulder."
>
> Marcus had been sitting in silence for several minutes. "What makes you say that?"
>
> "Your shoulder was a grade 2 strain. You've had worse and not visited." Dr. Chen set down her tablet. "You want to talk about something, but you're not sure how to start. I see it constantly. People come to my station for wounds they could treat themselves, because they need someone to listen who won't judge."
>
> "Is that part of the medical service?"
>
> "It's part of being human." She waited. "So. What are you actually here for?"
>
> Marcus was quiet for a long moment. "I let someone die. I could have saved them, but saving them would have gotten three other people killed. So I made a choice."
>
> "And now you need to know if that choice was acceptable."
>
> "Yes."
>
> Dr. Chen considered this. "In the ER, we called it triage. Limited resources, multiple patients, impossible decisions. The math is simple: save the most lives possible. The math is also irrelevant at 3 AM when you're staring at the ceiling remembering the ones you didn't save."
>
> "Does it get easier?"
>
> "No. You just get better at living with it."
