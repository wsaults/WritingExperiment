# Skills: Acquisition, Progression, and Application

## Skill Categories

Skills represent specific capabilities the System permits contestants to develop. Unlike stats (which are innate) or classes (which are assigned), skills are *earned* through action, discovery, and investment.

### Combat Skills

Direct damage-dealing, defensive, and tactical abilities used in fights.

**Examples**: Power Strike, Dodge, Parry, Analyze Enemy, Tactical Retreat

**Characteristics**:
- Often have cooldowns or resource costs
- Scale with relevant stats
- Most level through use in actual combat

### Utility Skills

Non-combat capabilities that aid survival, exploration, and problem-solving.

**Examples**: Lockpicking, Trap Detection, First Aid, Navigation, Identify Item

**Characteristics**:
- Broader application than combat skills
- Often passive or low-cost
- Essential for dungeon navigation

### Social Skills

Interactions with NPCs, factions, and (limited) other contestants.

**Examples**: Persuasion, Intimidation, Bargaining, Leadership, Deception

**Characteristics**:
- Scale primarily with CHA
- Affect faction reputation and shop prices
- Don't work on player-contestants (their choices remain free)

### Crafting Skills

Creation and modification of items, equipment, and consumables.

**Examples**: Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Cooking, Enchanting, Trap Making

**Characteristics**:
- Require materials and recipes
- Products scale with skill level
- Time-intensive but economically powerful

### Passive Skills

Always-active bonuses that don't require activation.

**Examples**: Danger Sense, Night Vision, Poison Resistance, Quick Recovery

**Characteristics**:
- No activation cost
- Level through time and exposure
- Often class-granted or achievement-unlocked

### Dungeon-Specific Skills

Capabilities that only function within certain dungeon types or environments.

**Examples**: Lava Walking, Undead Bane, Aquatic Adaptation, Dimensional Anchor

**Characteristics**:
- Powerful within niche
- Useless outside specific contexts
- Often rewards for completing relevant content

## Skill Acquisition

### Methods of Learning

**1. Level-Up Selection**
At each level, contestants receive 1 skill point. Points can be spent to:
- Acquire a new skill from available list
- Upgrade an existing skill's rank

Available skills depend on class, stats, and achievements. Not all skills are visible until requirements are met.

**2. Use-Based Discovery**
Repeated actions can spontaneously generate skills:
- Picking many locks → `[Skill Discovered: Lockpicking]`
- Surviving many poison hits → `[Skill Discovered: Poison Resistance]`
- Analyzing enough enemies → `[Skill Discovered: Pattern Recognition]`

The System rewards persistent behavior with mechanical backing.

**3. Achievement Unlocks**
Certain skills require specific achievements:
- Kill 100 enemies of one type → Species-specific combat skill
- Survive a near-death experience → Emergency skill
- Complete a hidden objective → Secret skill

Achievement skills are often more powerful than standard skills.

**4. Trainer NPCs**
Some dungeons include NPCs who teach skills for currency or favors:
- Often unique or rare skills
- May require quest completion
- Some skills can *only* be learned this way

**5. Skill Books**
Consumable items that grant skills directly:
- Found as loot or purchased
- One-time use
- Skill level depends on book quality

**6. Class Grants**
Each class provides a set of mandatory skills:
- Granted automatically at class assignment
- Cannot be removed
- Define class's baseline capabilities

## Skill Progression

### Skill Levels

Skills progress from Level 1 to Level 100 (theoretical maximum; most cap practically around 50-60).

**Level Ranges**:
| Level | Proficiency |
|-------|-------------|
| 1-10 | Novice—can perform basic applications |
| 11-25 | Apprentice—reliable, some advanced applications |
| 26-40 | Journeyman—competent, most applications available |
| 41-60 | Expert—high effectiveness, subtle applications |
| 61-80 | Master—exceptional capability, rare applications |
| 81-100 | Grandmaster—approaches theoretical maximum |

### How Skills Level

**Use-Based Progression**: Most combat and utility skills level through use.
- Each successful use grants skill XP
- More challenging applications grant more XP
- Repetitive grinding has diminishing returns (the System finds grinding boring)

**Point Investment**: Skill points can directly increase skill levels.
- 1 point = +5 levels (up to level 25)
- 1 point = +3 levels (26-50)
- 1 point = +1 level (51+)

**Breakthrough Events**: Dramatic or creative use can trigger sudden level jumps.
- Using a skill in an unexpected way
- Succeeding against overwhelming odds
- The System's "drama bonus" extends to skills

### Skill Ranks

Beyond levels, skills have quality tiers that affect their ceiling:

| Rank | Max Level | Acquisition |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Common | 30 | Default for most learned skills |
| Uncommon | 50 | Achievement unlocks, trainers |
| Rare | 70 | Quest rewards, skill books |
| Epic | 90 | Class-specific, major achievements |
| Legendary | 100 | Unique circumstances only |

Rank can be upgraded through:
- Achieving mastery milestones
- Specific achievements
- Rare consumables
- Class evolution

### Skill Synergies

Certain skill combinations provide bonuses:

**Example Synergies**:
- Analyze + Tactical Strike = +50% critical chance on analyzed targets
- Stealth + Backstab = +100% damage from concealment
- First Aid + Poison Resistance = Can neutralize toxins during treatment

Synergies aren't announced—contestants discover them through experimentation. The System considers synergy discovery entertaining.

## Marcus Reeves's Key Skills

### Analyze (Signature Skill)

**Rank**: Rare (upgraded from Common through achievements)
**Category**: Combat/Utility
**Acquisition**: Class grant (Analyst)

**Description**: The Analyst's core ability. Reveals target information with depth scaling on skill level and INT.

**Base Function**: Point at target, activate, receive data. Simple.

**How Marcus Uses It**:
- Chains analysis to understand dungeon systems, not just individual enemies
- Correlates data across multiple targets to identify patterns
- Uses partial information to make probability assessments
- Turns "support information" into "tactical advantage"

**Evolution Across Series**:

*Book 1 (Lv. 1-15)*: Basic enemy data. Marcus learns to read between the lines of what the System shows.

*Book 2 (Lv. 16-30)*: Behavioral prediction unlocks. Can anticipate enemy actions one move ahead.

*Book 3 (Lv. 31-45)*: Environmental analysis. Can assess dungeon mechanics, trap systems, structural weaknesses.

*Book 4 (Lv. 46-55)*: Network analysis. Can model how multiple enemies will interact and coordinate.

*Book 5 (Lv. 56+)*: System-level perception. Begins seeing the dungeon itself as analyzable—understands *why* things are designed as they are.

**Signature Narrative Uses**:
- Analyzing a boss's attack pattern to find the 0.3-second vulnerability window
- Recognizing that a dungeon's "puzzle" is actually a calibration sequence
- Identifying that enemy behavior indicates an unseen third party
- Understanding that a "trap" is actually an invitation from the System

### Pattern Recognition (Discovered Skill)

**Rank**: Uncommon
**Category**: Passive
**Acquisition**: Discovered through repeated analysis and observation

**Description**: Passively identifies repeating patterns in enemy behavior, environmental hazards, and System events.

**How It Works**: Marcus doesn't activate this—it runs constantly. When something repeats or follows a sequence, he *notices*. The skill provides a subtle mental highlight on pattern elements.

**Evolution Across Series**:

*Book 1*: Notices simple attack patterns. "It always leads with the left claw."

*Book 2*: Notices dungeon patterns. "The trap resets every thirty seconds."

*Book 3*: Notices behavioral patterns. "This NPC is lying—their stress responses repeat."

*Book 4*: Notices System patterns. "The System always does X before Y."

*Book 5*: Notices meta-patterns. Begins understanding *why* patterns exist.

**Signature Narrative Uses**:
- Recognizing a boss's "random" attacks follow a PRNG sequence he can predict
- Identifying that dungeon room layouts encode information
- Noticing that the System's "helpful" notifications form a pattern he's being trained to follow
- Realizing a faction's behavior mirrors corporate restructuring patterns from his old life

### Strategic Assessment (Class Skill)

**Rank**: Epic (Analyst class-specific)
**Category**: Combat
**Acquisition**: Class grant, enhanced at Strategist evolution

**Description**: Evaluates a combat situation holistically. Provides risk assessment, optimal positioning recommendations, and predicted outcomes.

**How It Differs From Analyze**: Analyze focuses on individual targets. Strategic Assessment evaluates entire scenarios—terrain, multiple enemies, ally positions, resource states, and probable developments.

**Cost**: 50 MP, 5-minute cooldown

**Output Example**:
```
[STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT]
Threat Level: High
Survival Probability: 34% (current approach)
Recommended Action: Tactical retreat to corridor
Predicted Outcome: Survival probability +28% with
repositioning; -15% if engaged directly
Note: Eastern alcove contains unidentified entity
(assessment incomplete)
```

**Signature Narrative Uses**:
- Realizing mid-combat that "winning" the fight is the wrong objective
- Identifying that an ally's death is *mathematically optimal* (and refusing anyway)
- Recognizing that the "easy path" has worse predicted outcomes than the hard one
- Using incomplete assessment data to make intuitive leaps the System didn't model

---

### Exploit Identification (Discovered Skill)

**Rank**: Rare (unique discovery)
**Category**: Utility
**Acquisition**: Discovered after repeatedly finding and using System edge cases

**Description**: Highlights potential rules exploits, unintended interactions, and edge cases in dungeon mechanics.

**Why This Skill Exists**: Marcus treated the System like code from day one—looking for bugs, undefined behavior, and exploitable assumptions. The System found this *fascinating* and eventually formalized it as a skill.

**How It Works**: Passive awareness of "this probably wasn't intended." Not a guarantee—the skill suggests possibilities, not certainties.

**Limitations**: The System can patch exploits. Using the same trick too many times attracts attention. The skill provides opportunities, not invincibility.

**Signature Narrative Uses**:
- Realizing a "mandatory" boss fight can be skipped by triggering a spawn conflict
- Identifying that certain item combinations produce undefined stat interactions
- Noticing that a dungeon's time limit doesn't account for a specific zone transition
- Understanding that "impossible" requirements have asterisks the System doesn't advertise

---

### Tactical Strike (Learned Skill)

**Rank**: Common → Uncommon (upgraded through use)
**Category**: Combat
**Acquisition**: Trained after accumulating enough combat data

**Description**: A precision attack targeting weak points identified by Analyze.

**Why An Analyst Has A Combat Skill**: Marcus can't match Warriors in raw damage. But Analysts know *where* to hit. Tactical Strike translates information advantage into damage.

**Scaling**: Damage based on target's identified weak points. A fully-analyzed enemy takes significantly more damage than an unknown one.

**Cost**: 20 MP, 5-second cooldown

**Signature Narrative Uses**:
- Threading an attack through armor gaps only visible in Analyze data
- Targeting structural weak points on constructs and golems
- Disrupting enemy skill use by striking mid-cast
- Making kills that look impossible because the Analyze data isn't visible to observers

---

### Dungeon Sense (Passive Skill)

**Rank**: Uncommon
**Category**: Passive/Dungeon-Specific
**Acquisition**: Achievement unlock (surviving first dungeon clear)

**Description**: Awareness of dungeon environment, phase transitions, and spatial anomalies.

**What It Provides**:
- Sense of dungeon "direction" (where progression leads)
- Warning before phase transitions
- Awareness of dimensional instability
- Partial map generation based on movement

**Evolution Across Series**:
At higher levels, becomes *Dungeon Intuition*—can sense dungeon "mood," designer intent, and narrative beats the dungeon is building toward.

---

### Emergency Dodge (Reactive Skill)

**Rank**: Common
**Category**: Combat (Defensive)
**Acquisition**: Use-discovered after multiple near-death experiences

**Description**: Desperation evasion triggered when normal reactions are too slow.

**How It Works**: Semi-automatic. When lethal damage is imminent and normal dodge fails, Emergency Dodge burns extra resources for a last-chance evasion.

**Cost**: 30 Stamina + 20 HP (self-damage from strain)
**Cooldown**: 60 seconds

**Limitations**: Doesn't guarantee survival—only provides one additional dodge. Can't be used if already at low HP (the cost would kill you).

**Signature Narrative Uses**:
- Escaping attacks Marcus absolutely should not have been able to avoid
- Creating dramatic moments where survival seems impossible
- Providing cost for survival (the HP damage compounds across fights)

---

## Skill Interaction Philosophy

Skills aren't balanced for fairness—they're balanced for *narrative potential*.

**Analyst skills** provide information and precision that *could* be overpowered if the System allowed perfect execution. It doesn't. Cooldowns, MP costs, and incomplete data ensure Marcus always has to fill gaps with judgment.

**The gap between knowing and doing** is the Analyst's core tension. Marcus might know exactly where to strike but lack the STR to strike hard enough. He might understand the perfect strategy but lack the allies to execute it.

**The System rewards creativity over repetition.** Using skills in novel ways generates more progression than grinding standard applications. Marcus's build is optimized for improvisation, not rotation.
