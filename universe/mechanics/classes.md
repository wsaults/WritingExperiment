# Classes: Roles, Progression, and Specialization

## Class System Overview

### How Classes Are Assigned

The System assigns initial classes during the **Integration Event**—the traumatic first minutes after a contestant enters dungeon space. The assignment considers:

1. **Pre-System aptitudes**: Skills, knowledge, and tendencies from baseline life
2. **Initial stat distribution**: Natural strengths shape available options
3. **Psychological profile**: Decision-making patterns under stress
4. **Entertainment potential**: The System considers what would be *interesting*

Contestants don't choose their starting class. They receive what the System determines fits—or what would create compelling viewing. A former soldier might receive Warrior. They might also receive Healer, because watching someone fight their nature produces drama.

**Assignment Notification**:
> `[Class Assigned: Analyst]`
> `[The System has evaluated your capabilities and found them... specialized]`

## Class Tiers

### Basic Classes (Levels 1-29)

Starting classes. Broad archetypes with general capabilities. All contestants begin here.

**Characteristics**:
- 10 class skill slots
- No prestige abilities
- Standard stat bonuses (+2 to primary stat per 10 levels)
- Evolution options unlock at Level 30

### Advanced Classes (Levels 30-69)

Specializations within archetypes. Chosen at Level 30 from options the System offers based on performance and build.

**Characteristics**:
- 15 class skill slots
- One prestige ability
- Enhanced stat bonuses (+3 to primary stat per 10 levels)
- Further evolution at Level 70

**Example Evolution Path**:
Warrior (Basic) → Berserker, Knight, Weapon Master, or Duelist (Advanced)

### Prestige Classes (Levels 70+)

Rare specializations requiring specific achievements, stat thresholds, or narrative milestones. The System doesn't offer these—contestants must discover and unlock them.

**Characteristics**:
- 20 class skill slots
- Three prestige abilities
- Unique passive bonuses
- Often dungeon-specific or faction-locked

**Example**: *Voidwalker* requires surviving a dimensional collapse, INT 60+, and a secret achievement. Fewer than 200 contestants have ever achieved it.

## Multi-Classing Rules

The System *technically* allows multi-classing. In practice, it's a trap.

**How It Works**:
- At any class evolution point, contestants can split into two classes
- Each class progresses at 60% normal rate
- Skill slots are divided between classes

**Why It's Usually Bad**:
- Diluted progression means weaker at everything
- Class synergies rarely compensate for lost specialization
- The System seems to punish it with harder encounters

**When It Works**:
- Hybrid builds that genuinely need two capability sets
- Specific class combinations with documented synergies
- Contestants who've hit effective caps in their primary class

**Multi-Class Notation**: `Warrior 45 / Mage 32`

---

## Class Change Mechanics

Changing classes is possible but costly:

**Requirements**:
- Class Change Token (rare drop, faction reward, or purchased)
- Return to Level 1 in new class
- Retain 25% of earned stat points
- Lose all class-specific skills
- Keep universal skills

**Why Anyone Does This**:
- Realized current class is fundamentally unsuited
- Strategic need for different capability
- The extremely rare "perfect fit" class becomes available

Most contestants never change class. Those who do usually regret it.

## Protagonist's Class: Analyst

### Initial Assignment

When the System integrated Marcus Reeves, it evaluated:
- High INT, above-average PER
- Documented skill in systems integration and debugging
- Pattern-recognition aptitude
- Tendency to observe before acting

The System assigned **Analyst**—a support class typically used for party coordination and enemy assessment. It's considered one of the weakest solo classes, rarely chosen by viewers as a favorite.

**Assignment Commentary**:
> `[Class Assigned: Analyst]`
> `[Traditionally employed in support roles. The System notes your lack of traditional support temperament with interest]`

### Why This Class (Narrative Justification)

The System gave Marcus Analyst for entertainment reasons:

1. **Underdog Potential**: Analyst has no direct combat abilities. A solo Analyst surviving dungeons is inherently dramatic.

2. **Subversion Arc**: Watching someone take a "weak" class and make it dangerous produces novelty.

3. **Information Asymmetry**: Analysts *know* more than other classes. This creates tension between what Marcus understands and what he can actually do about it.

4. **The System's Curiosity**: Marcus's background in systems exploitation piqued interest. What happens when you give a systems thinker a window into *this* system?

### How Marcus Subverts Class Expectations

Traditional Analysts sit behind parties, calling out enemy weaknesses and coordinating tactics. Marcus has no party for most of Book 1. He adapts:

**Information as Weapon**: His Analyze skill reveals enemy patterns. He uses this to exploit behavioral loops, environmental hazards, and timing windows that brute-force fighters miss.

**System Exploitation**: Analyst skills provide more detailed System information. Marcus treats the interface like code—looking for edge cases, unintended interactions, and exploitable rules.

**Tactical Depth Over Power**: He can't out-damage a Warrior. He can position to make enemies defeat themselves.

**Commentary and Prediction**: High-level Analyst skills can predict enemy actions. Marcus weaponizes this, setting traps based on what he knows enemies will do.

### Class Evolution Path

**Level 1-29**: Analyst (Basic)
- Core loop: Analyze → Exploit → Survive
- Develops unconventional combat applications

**Level 30**: Evolution to **Strategist** (Advanced)
- Gains limited tactical abilities
- Can affect party members' stats through planning
- Prestige ability: *Perfect Recall*—replays any analyzed encounter in memory

**Level 70**: Evolution to **System Archaeologist** (Prestige)
- Unique class Marcus unlocks through narrative events
- Can perceive System mechanics other classes cannot
- Can identify dungeon design intentions
- Prestige abilities alter how the System interface functions for him

## Class Synergies and Party Dynamics

### Optimal Party Composition

The System rewards diverse parties over stacked compositions:

**Standard Template** (5-person party):
- 1 Tank (Warrior, Paladin)
- 1-2 DPS (Rogue, Ranger, Mage, Monk)
- 1 Support (Healer, Bard)
- 1 Utility (Analyst, Summoner)

**Why Diversity Matters**: Homogeneous parties (all Warriors, all Mages) face content calibrated against their weaknesses. The System identifies "boring" compositions and makes them harder.

### Class Synergy Examples

| Class A | Class B | Synergy Effect |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Analyst | Rogue | Weak point data enables guaranteed crits |
| Healer | Paladin | Overlapping sustain creates unkillable frontline |
| Mage | Summoner | Summons can tank while mage channels |
| Bard | Warrior | Buff stacking reaches absurd damage numbers |
| Analyst | Everyone | Information sharing benefits entire party |

### Marcus's Party Dynamics (Across Series)

**Book 1**: Solo survival—no synergies, maximum difficulty.

**Book 2**: Small group forms. Marcus provides tactical value that exceeds his combat contribution.

**Book 3**: Established party. Marcus becomes the strategic core—weaker in direct fights but invaluable for planning.

**Book 4**: Party evolution. Some members change; Marcus adapts to new synergies.

**Book 5**: Final composition. Party dynamics reach peak optimization.

---

## Class Balance Philosophy

The System doesn't aim for balance. It aims for *interesting*.

**Nominally "weak" classes** (Analyst, Bard, Luck Manipulator) have low direct combat power but can produce narrative reversals that viewers love.

**Nominally "strong" classes** (Warrior, Mage) provide consistent performance but rarely surprise.

The System adjusts difficulty based on party composition. A solo Analyst faces different challenges than a full party with the same total level. The goal is always: make it survivable but not easy, dramatic but not unfair.

### Class Assignment Statistics

Among human contestants:
- 35% receive combat classes (Warrior, Rogue, Ranger)
- 25% receive magic classes (Mage, Healer, Summoner)
- 20% receive support classes (Analyst, Bard)
- 15% receive hybrid classes (Paladin, Monk)
- 5% receive rare/unusual classes

The System ensures variety—if too many Warriors are assigned, it adjusts. Entertainment requires diversity.
