# System Rules: Core Mechanics and Principles

## How The System Manifests

### The Interface

Contestants perceive the System through **direct neural projection**—text boxes, notifications, and status windows that appear to float in their field of vision. This isn't augmented reality; it's reality augmentation at the perception layer. The interface can't be removed, blocked, or hacked by contestants. It's part of them now.

**Visual Characteristics**:
- Semi-transparent blue-white text on dark background
- Sharp serif font (reminiscent of formal documentation)
- Text scales based on urgency—routine notifications are small; critical warnings expand to fill vision
- Position: Upper-right peripheral by default; contestants can mentally adjust placement
- Persistence: Notifications fade after 3-7 seconds unless dismissed or flagged important

**Audio Component**: Optional audio cues accompany critical notifications—a soft chime for rewards, a low buzz for warnings, silence for deaths (because silence is more unsettling). Contestants can mute audio but cannot mute visual.

### Notification Categories

| Type | Visual Style | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Status Update** | Gray border, neutral tone | `[Skill "Analyze" has reached Level 4]` |
| **Combat Alert** | Red border, pulsing | `[Warning: Elite Enemy Detected]` |
| **Reward** | Gold border, bright | `[Achievement Unlocked: First Blood]` |
| **System Message** | Blue border, formal | `[Dungeon Phase 2 will begin in 00:30:00]` |
| **Commentary** | No border, italic | `[The System notes your resourcefulness with mild interest]` |

## System Personality

The System is not neutral. It has *voice*—sardonic, occasionally cruel, surprisingly helpful when it feels like it. Whether this personality represents original design intent, emergent behavior, or something else is unknown. What matters is that the System *chooses* how to communicate.

### Communication Patterns

**Formal Mode** (default for mechanical updates):
> `[You have gained 247 Experience Points]`
> `[New Skill Available: Dungeon Sense]`

**Commentary Mode** (when the System has opinions):
> `[Achievement Unlocked: Survived Through Luck Rather Than Skill]`
> `[The System recommends against repeating that particular strategy]`
> `[Your party member's death has been noted. Condolences are not within the System's parameters]`

**Cryptic Mode** (hints disguised as snark):
> `[Interesting choice. The previous contestant who tried that approach is now part of the dungeon's decorative architecture]`
> `[The System observes that the eastern passage has been unusually quiet. Make of that what you will]`

### What The System Reveals

**Always Shows**:
- Own stats, skills, and resources
- Party member status (alive/dead, general health tier)
- Active quests and objectives
- Loot acquired and currency totals
- Dungeon phase information and time remaining

**Sometimes Shows** (based on relevant skills, System mood, or entertainment value):
- Enemy health bars (requires Analyze skill or equivalent)
- Hidden passages and traps (partial reveals to maintain tension)
- Other contestants' levels (never stats; that would spoil betting)
- Hint text when struggle would be entertaining but death would be boring

**Never Shows**:
- Future dungeon layouts or boss mechanics
- Other contestants' full builds or strategies
- System-level information (how it works, who controls it)
- Anything that would remove dramatic tension

### System Biases

The System demonstrably *prefers* certain behaviors:

**Rewarded** (bonus XP, better drops, favorable commentary):
- Creative solutions to standard problems
- Underdog victories against higher-level threats
- Dramatic comebacks from near-death
- Inter-contestant cooperation that increases narrative complexity
- Suffering that produces good viewing without being boring

**Punished** (reduced rewards, unfavorable RNG, pointed commentary):
- Exploits that trivialize content
- Grinding without narrative engagement
- Passive play styles that don't generate entertainment
- Cruelty toward other contestants beyond what drama requires

**Neutral** (no adjustment):
- Standard competent play
- Expected strategic choices
- Deaths that serve narrative purpose

## Leveling Mechanics

### Experience Sources

Experience points (XP) flow from actions the System deems entertaining:

| Source | Base XP | Modifiers |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Monster Kill** | Varies by monster level and type | +50% for solo, +25% for under-leveled, -25% for over-leveled |
| **Quest Completion** | Fixed per quest tier | +100% for optional objectives, +50% for speed bonuses |
| **Discovery** | 50-500 per discovery | Scales with rarity and entertainment value |
| **Achievement** | 100-10,000 per achievement | One-time bonuses for notable firsts |
| **Survival** | 10 per hour in active danger | Baseline "staying alive is work" acknowledgment |
| **Drama Bonus** | Variable | System discretionary award for entertaining moments |

**The Drama Bonus**: The System can award (or withhold) significant XP for moments it finds particularly engaging. A desperate last-stand that nearly fails but succeeds spectacularly might triple the XP a clean victory would provide. This is arbitrary and contestants hate it, but it's also the primary driver of interesting play.

### Level Scaling

The leveling curve follows an **exponential soft-cap** model:

**Levels 1-20**: Rapid early progression. XP requirements increase by ~15% per level. This is the "tutorial range" where contestants learn the system.

**Levels 21-50**: Moderate progression. XP requirements increase by ~25% per level. Most contestants plateau somewhere in this range.

**Levels 51-80**: Slow progression. XP requirements increase by ~40% per level. Reserved for serious competitors and long-term survivors.

**Levels 81-100**: Glacial progression. XP requirements increase by ~60% per level. Reaching level 100 represents years of survival.

**Level 100+**: Theoretical only. No human has reached this. The XP requirements reportedly become astronomical, and the System allegedly has "special content" for those who do.

### What Levels Provide

Each level grants:

**+3 Stat Points**: Freely allocated to any primary stat.

**+1 Skill Point**: Spent on skill acquisition or advancement.

**Passive Scaling**: All derived stats (Health, Mana, Defense) increase based on level. Higher levels are inherently more durable even without stat investment.

**Unlock Thresholds**: Certain capabilities unlock at specific levels:
- Level 10: Class specialization options
- Level 20: Advanced skill trees
- Level 30: Prestige class availability
- Level 50: Legendary skill access
- Level 75: ???
- Level 100: Ascension pathway (rumored)

**Display Format**:
> `[Level 17 | XP: 34,721 / 52,000]`
> `[Unspent Points: Stat 3 | Skill 1]`

## Death and Consequences

### The Permadeath Question

Death in dungeons is *usually* permanent. The System records contestant consciousness at death for Archive storage, but resurrection is not standard.

**However**: The System has exceptions. Death mechanics vary by dungeon type, faction sponsorship, and entertainment requirements.

### Death Categories

**Standard Death** (most common):
- Contestant dies
- Consciousness archived
- Body converted to dungeon resources
- No return

**Sponsored Revival** (rare, expensive):
- A faction or wealthy patron pre-purchases revival rights
- Upon death, contestant is restored at dungeon entrance
- Costs: massive currency, faction standing, or future obligations
- Limits: Usually 1-3 revivals per dungeon; each subsequent revival costs exponentially more
- Penalties: Lose 10% of total XP, random skill degradation, psychological trauma effects

**Checkpoint Revival** (dungeon-specific):
- Some dungeons include revival mechanics as part of their design
- Contestants respawn at checkpoints with penalties
- Penalties vary: XP loss, stat reduction, timer reduction, resource confiscation
- Designed to extend entertainment value of promising contestants

**Arena Revival** (PvP specific):
- Contestant-versus-contestant content often includes revival
- Death is temporary for matches; permanent if contestant "retires" from arena
- Used to showcase combat without eliminating valuable entertainment assets

### Near-Death States

Before actual death, contestants experience:

**Critical Condition**: Below 10% health. Movement impaired, skills weakened, System displays warning. Recovery possible with healing or rest.

**Death's Door**: Below 1% health. Unable to act, System countdown begins (usually 30-60 seconds). Can be stabilized by ally intervention, healing items, or certain skills.

**System Intervention**: At 0.1% health, the System may (not will) intervene if the death would be "narratively unsatisfying." This manifests as a brief invulnerability window, an enemy stumble, or a convenient environmental shift. This is rare and never guaranteed—contestants cannot count on it.

### Death Penalties (When Revived)

Revival always costs something:

| Penalty Type | Effect | Duration |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| **XP Loss** | 10-25% of total XP | Permanent |
| **Stat Shock** | -5 to all stats | 24 hours dungeon time |
| **Skill Fog** | Random skill temporarily locked | 1-7 days dungeon time |
| **Psychological Trauma** | Stress mechanic activation | Until processed |
| **Debt** | Owe sponsor/System for revival cost | Until paid |

### The Archive

All contestants who die have their consciousness recorded. The Consortium claims this is for entertainment replay purposes. The truth is more complex—the Archive is a collection of *every mind that ever died in the games*, preserved in perfect fidelity.

What happens to archived consciousnesses is unknown. Consortium officials suggest they're used for "advanced entertainment experiences." Critics suspect something else entirely.

## System Limitations

### What The System Cannot Do

Even godlike entities have constraints:

**Cannot Predict Free Will**: The System can model probability but not certainty. Contestant choices remain genuinely undetermined until made.

**Cannot Violate Its Own Rules**: Once rules are established for a dungeon, the System follows them. It can interpret creatively but not arbitrarily change outcomes.

**Cannot Operate Outside Dungeons**: The System's reality manipulation only functions within dungeon space. Baseline reality follows normal physics.

**Cannot Force Actions**: The System can incentivize, punish, and manipulate, but it cannot directly control contestant behavior. This is apparently fundamental to entertainment value—viewers want to see real choices.

**Cannot Be Explained**: The System doesn't explain itself. Why certain rules exist, why certain rewards are given, why certain contestants survive when others die—these remain opaque. The mystery is intentional.

### What The System Chooses Not To Do

Some limitations are policy, not physics:

- Won't remove the interface (contestants have tried; it doesn't work)
- Won't reveal its operators or origins
- Won't provide certainty about anything important
- Won't guarantee fairness (fairness is boring)
- Won't confirm whether it's conscious, programmed, or something else

## The Unwritten Rules

Experienced contestants learn that the System operates by patterns that aren't officially documented:

1. **Entertainment Trumps Everything**: If a choice produces better viewing, the System favors it.

2. **The System Remembers**: Past actions influence future encounters. Contestants who consistently produce drama receive more opportunities.

3. **Hidden Achievements Exist**: The System tracks behaviors it never announces. These influence luck statistics, drop rates, and encounter types.

4. **Asking Doesn't Help**: The System ignores direct questions about its mechanics. Experimentation is the only teacher.

5. **It's Watching**: Always. Even when quiet. The System's silence doesn't mean absence.
