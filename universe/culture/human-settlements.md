# Human Settlements

Post-harvest human civilization has reorganized into three primary settlement patterns, each representing different survival philosophies in response to the games' arrival on Earth.

## Fortress Communities

### Overview

Fortress Communities are the largest and most structured human settlements—defensible positions where survivors have chosen to stand their ground rather than flee. They typically occupy pre-existing infrastructure: military bases, prison complexes, industrial facilities, or university campuses with solid construction.

Population ranges from 200 to 2,000 inhabitants. Below 200, a settlement lacks the manpower to maintain constant defense. Above 2,000, resource strain and social friction tend to cause fragmentation.

### Characteristics

**Physical Structure**:
- Perimeter walls (often improvised from vehicles, shipping containers, or construction materials)
- Multiple fallback positions
- Designated safe zones for non-combatants
- Rationed resource storage
- Dungeon proximity monitoring

**Social Organization**:
- Clear hierarchy, often military or quasi-military
- Defined roles: defenders, scavengers, crafters, administrators
- Formal resource allocation systems
- Internal justice mechanisms (varies from fair to brutal)
- Training programs for System combat

**Relationship with Games**:
- Active dungeon engagement (organized clearing parties)
- Level requirements for certain privileges
- Skill specialization encouraged
- System knowledge hoarded and controlled

### Advantages

- Safety in numbers
- Resource pooling
- Knowledge sharing
- Training infrastructure
- Social stability

### Disadvantages

- High resource consumption
- Attractive targets for hostile factions (human and otherwise)
- Political infighting
- Rigid hierarchies that may not reward merit
- Difficult to relocate when dungeons spawn nearby

### Notable Examples

**Camp Stanford** (California): Built around the university's engineering facilities. Known for systematic approach to System analysis and dungeon mapping. Runs the closest thing to formal education that still exists.

**The Stockade** (Texas): Former private prison. Controversial leadership but undeniably effective defense. Rumors of harsh internal discipline and questionable recruitment practices.

**Harbor Hold** (Seattle): Port facility with boat access. One of the few communities with reliable fishing and maritime escape routes. Strong trade relationships with nomadic bands.

## Nomadic Bands

### Overview

Nomadic Bands are mobile survival groups that prioritize flexibility over fortification. They follow patterns—seasonal resources, dungeon spawn cycles, or trade routes—never staying anywhere long enough to attract concentrated attention.

Band size ranges from 8 to 50 members. Smaller groups lack sufficient skills diversity and combat capability. Larger groups become logistically unwieldy and leave trails too obvious to ignore.

### Characteristics

**Movement Patterns**:
- Continuous relocation (rarely more than 2 weeks in one location)
- Established waypoint networks
- Weather-responsive routing
- Dungeon-avoidance protocols
- Emergency scatter-and-regroup procedures

**Social Organization**:
- Flat hierarchy (leaders emerge situationally)
- Universal participation in survival tasks
- Skill-sharing mandatory
- Consensus decision-making (when time permits)
- Easy entry but enforced contribution

**Relationship with Games**:
- Opportunistic dungeon engagement (hit-and-run tactics)
- Diverse but shallow skill development
- Trade System knowledge for supplies
- Avoid high-level content that attracts attention

### Advantages

- Hard to target
- Adaptive to changing conditions
- Lower resource requirements per person
- Access to varied territories
- Freedom from rigid social structures

### Disadvantages

- No permanent safe zone
- Limited carrying capacity
- Vulnerable during movement
- Difficulty maintaining injured/elderly members
- Children complicate mobility

### Notable Patterns

**The Circuit Riders** (Midwest): Follow a predictable loop through agricultural areas, trading dungeon-clearing services for food. Known for reliability and fair dealing.

**Ghost Pack** (Pacific Northwest): Forest specialists who've developed movement techniques that leave virtually no trail. Rarely seen; existence confirmed mainly through trade goods that appear at dead drops.

**The Caravan** (Southwest): Vehicle-based band that maintains a fleet of modified trucks and buses. Faster than foot-mobile groups but fuel-dependent. Known for aggressive scavenging operations.

## Hidden Enclaves

### Overview

Hidden Enclaves are the secret option—communities that survive primarily by remaining undetected. They occupy locations that don't register as settlements: underground facilities, isolated islands, dense urban ruins that appear abandoned, or regions where dungeon activity discourages investigation.

Population is strictly limited, typically 30-150 inhabitants. Larger groups generate signatures (resource consumption, waste, electromagnetic emissions) that eventually attract attention.

### Characteristics

**Concealment Methods**:
- Underground or enclosed construction
- Minimal external signature (light, sound, smoke)
- Misleading surface appearances
- Decoy locations
- Information compartmentalization (members don't know full layout)

**Social Organization**:
- Tight-knit communities (everyone knows everyone)
- Strict security protocols
- Careful vetting of new members
- Emphasis on self-sufficiency
- Long-term thinking over immediate gain

**Relationship with Games**:
- Minimal dungeon engagement (detection risk)
- Focus on non-combat System skills
- Cultivation of unique resources
- Trade only through cutouts and intermediaries

### Advantages

- Protection through obscurity
- Lower conflict exposure
- Stable, sustainable resource use
- Strong community bonds
- Long-term viability

### Disadvantages

- Limited growth potential
- Paranoia as cultural default
- Isolation from broader human networks
- Vulnerability if discovered
- Skill stagnation without dungeon experience

### Notable Examples

**The Depths** (Somewhere): A former government continuity facility, location classified even among inhabitants. Rumored to maintain pre-games technology and organized research into System mechanics. Existence unconfirmed but widely believed.

**Archipelago** (Great Lakes): Network of small island communities connected by boat routes known only to members. Each island appears abandoned from shore. Population distributed to prevent catastrophic loss.

**Undertown** (Urban, Location Varies): Generic term for survivor communities in subway systems, utility tunnels, and underground infrastructure. Multiple independent groups use the term. Quality and safety vary enormously.

## Inter-Settlement Dynamics

### Trade Networks

Despite different philosophies, the three settlement types have developed symbiotic relationships:

- **Fortress → Nomadic**: Manufactured goods, medical care, System training in exchange for scouting reports, rare resources, message carrying
- **Nomadic → Hidden**: Early warning of threats, wider-world information in exchange for specialized goods, safe harbor during emergencies
- **Hidden → Fortress**: Unique products (medicine, preserved technology, cultivated resources) in exchange for protection agreements, population overflow acceptance

### Conversion Patterns

Survivors often move between settlement types as circumstances change:

- Young adults leave Hidden Enclaves to gain dungeon experience with Nomadic Bands
- Injured or aging Nomads retire to Fortress Communities
- Fortress refugees fleeing internal conflicts join Bands or seek Enclaves
- Successful Bands sometimes settle into Fortress establishment

### Territorial Conflicts

Competition for resources creates friction:

- Fortress expansion threatens Hidden Enclave security
- Nomadic scavenging depletes resources Fortresses claim
- Hidden trade goods undercut Fortress monopolies
- Dungeon spawn events displace all types simultaneously

Violence between human settlements occurs but is generally avoided—the games provide enough enemies without adding internal conflict.

## Marcus's Perspective

The protagonist likely encounters all three types during the series:

**Book 1**: Initial survival probably involves Nomadic-style movement before encountering first Fortress Community.

**Books 2-3**: Deeper engagement with Fortress politics and Hidden Enclave networks as faction involvement increases.

**Books 4-5**: All settlement types become relevant as human coordination becomes necessary against larger threats.

His engineering background gives him value to all three types—systems thinking for Fortress defense, problem-solving for Nomadic challenges, technical skills for Hidden self-sufficiency.
