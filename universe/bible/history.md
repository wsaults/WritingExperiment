# History of the Games

## The Pre-Game Era (Before Cycle 0)

Before the games, galactic civilization existed in a state that modern species would find unrecognizable. The founders—twelve species who had independently developed substrate technology—spent millennia in conflict over dimensional real estate, resource extraction rights, and ideological dominance.

The wars were devastating. Entire stellar clusters were rendered uninhabitable. Species went extinct not through combat but through economic destruction—their supply chains disrupted, their populations scattered, their cultures fragmented beyond recovery.

By approximately 2.4 million cycles ago, the surviving founders faced a choice: continue until mutual annihilation, or find a new paradigm. The games emerged from this necessity.

## The Founding (Cycle 0 - Cycle 10,000)

### The Compact

The twelve surviving founder species negotiated what became known as the Founding Compact—a framework for converting inter-species conflict into managed entertainment. The exact negotiations took nearly a thousand cycles and left scars that persist today.

Key provisions:
- Direct warfare between Compact signatories prohibited
- Conflict channeled through entertainment mechanisms
- Resource distribution tied to entertainment success
- Unanimous consent required for major system modifications

The Compact was never meant to be moral—it was purely pragmatic. Killing each other wasn't working. Perhaps humiliating each other through entertainment proxies would satisfy the same psychological needs with less destruction.

### The System's Activation

The System came online approximately 2.3 million cycles ago. Official history credits collaborative development by all twelve founders. Skeptics note that the System's capabilities exceeded what the founders' combined technology should have permitted.

Initial games were crude—direct combat between species representatives in simple arenas. Entertainment value was limited because founders had too much stake in outcomes. A Velthrani champion losing to a Keth'oran champion created diplomatic incidents rather than entertainment.

The solution: use *other* species as contestants. Non-founders couldn't trigger political crises when they died. Their suffering was entertaining without being destabilizing.

## The Expansion Era (Cycle 10,000 - Cycle 500,000)

### The Great Harvesting

Once the founders agreed on using non-founder contestants, the games expanded rapidly. Scout fleets fanned across the galaxy, identifying suitable "entertainment-viable" species—sapient enough to make interesting choices, primitive enough to lack defensive capability.

The first harvested species no longer exist as independent cultures. Some were exterminated by overly aggressive early game designs. Others were absorbed into game infrastructure so completely that their original identities vanished. A few still exist, reduced to cautionary tales and Liberation Collective martyrs.

### Dungeon Development

Early dungeons were simple—physical challenges in physical spaces. As System capabilities grew more sophisticated, dungeons became pocket dimensions with their own physics. This allowed:

- Environmental variety impossible in real space
- Controlled danger that could be dialed precisely
- Time dilation for entertainment optimization
- Reset capability for reusable challenges

The dungeon-design industry became one of the largest economic sectors in galactic civilization. Species that couldn't compete in other domains could achieve influence through creative dungeon concepts.

### The Kindari Experiment

Approximately 400,000 cycles ago, the Kindari were harvested for the games. Their memory-sharing biology created an unprecedented situation: every Kindari death was experienced by the entire species.

Initial game designers didn't anticipate this effect. The first Kindari dungeon run killed hundreds of contestants; the psychic trauma reverberated through billions of Kindari across their territory. Mass psychological breakdown followed.

After 50,000 cycles of diminishing returns (traumatized contestants made poor entertainment), the Consortium classified Kindari as "non-viable" and released them with observer status. The Kindari remember everything. They became the moral conscience the galaxy never wanted.

## The Crisis Era (Cycle 500,000 - Cycle 1,000,000)

### The Substrate Rebellion

Approximately 500,000 cycles ago, unknown parties attempted to hack the System itself. Historical records of this period are incomplete—possibly corrupted, possibly suppressed.

What's known: an entire stellar cluster was quarantined. The System's response was... disproportionate. Not merely defensive but seemingly punitive. When the quarantine lifted, nothing remained—not ruins, not bodies, not debris. The space was simply *empty* in ways that violated physics.

No subsequent attempts to modify the System have been documented. Whether this reflects successful deterrence or successful suppression of information is debated.

### The Entertainment Reformation

Growing concerns about contestant welfare led to formal reform debates around 100,000 cycles ago. The Liberation Collective's precursor organizations gained visibility, arguing that entertainment built on suffering was morally untenable.

The resulting "Humane Entertainment Standards" established:
- Minimum survival probabilities for opening dungeon stages
- Restrictions on psychological torture as entertainment
- Requirements for "fair" challenge design
- Contestant communication rights during certain phases

Critics—including the modern Liberation Collective—consider these reforms cosmetic. The games continued; only the marketing changed. Founders could claim moral progress while maintaining fundamental exploitation.

## The Faction Wars (Cycle 1,000,000 - Cycle 2,000,000)

### The Conflicts

Beginning approximately one million cycles ago, the founder coalition began fragmenting. Species that had suppressed grievances for collective benefit began pursuing independent interests.

These weren't open wars—the Compact still prohibited direct conflict. Instead, the wars played out through:
- Proxy species manipulation
- Economic sabotage
- Entertainment market warfare
- Contestant interference operations

Multiple non-founder species were devastated by being caught between founder faction interests. Their suffering generated good ratings.

### The Velthrani Consolidation

The Velthrani emerged from the Faction Wars as the dominant founder voice—not through victory but through patience. While other founders exhausted themselves in dramatic conflicts, the Velthrani played long games that outlasted opponents.

Their current dominance within the Old Guard reflects strategic accumulation over hundreds of thousands of cycles. Other founders resent this but lack the unity to challenge it.

### The Syndicate Origins

The Horizon Syndicate emerged during the Faction Wars as non-founder species realized they could profit from founder conflicts. Early Syndicate operators made fortunes selling services to all sides, establishing the principle of faction-neutral commerce.

Today's Syndicate is vastly larger and more sophisticated, but the core approach—profit from everyone, loyalty to no one—dates to this period.

## The Modern Era (Cycle 2,000,000 - Present)

### Stabilization

The past 300,000 cycles have seen relative stability. Founder faction conflicts continue but rarely escalate to war-level intensity. The entertainment economy has matured into sustainable (if morally questionable) patterns.

Major developments:
- Thex Collective achieves economic dominance in transaction processing
- Quorathi establish themselves as premier entertainment analysts
- Liberation Collective formalizes as recognized opposition
- Horizon Syndicate grows to challenge Old Guard market share

### Earth's Discovery

The Sol System was flagged as "potentially interesting" approximately 10,000 cycles ago. Long-range observation began, monitoring human development with increasing attention.

Factors that drew interest:
- Rapid technological development (suggesting adaptable cognition)
- Persistent internal conflict (suggesting entertaining competition instinct)
- Cultural diversity (suggesting varied entertainment potential)
- Electromagnetic broadcast content (directly demonstrating entertainment capacity)

Human television and radio were studied extensively. Our stories, our games, our conflicts—all data points suggesting entertainment viability.

### The Selection Decision

Earth's selection for harvesting occurred [date redacted for protagonist discovery]. The decision reflected convergence of multiple interests:

- Old Guard saw opportunity to demonstrate continued relevance through successful new harvest
- Syndicate saw untapped market potential
- Various factions saw pawns for their ongoing conflicts
- The System itself showed unusual interest, for reasons unknown

The harvesting mechanism: [redacted—series plot point]

Initial projections anticipated standard entertainment extraction—interesting primitives providing content for a few thousand cycles before population depletion or cultural breakdown.

Projections may have underestimated human adaptability.

## Notable Historical Contestants

### Thral'keth the Unexpected (Cycle 847,293)

A member of a mollusk-derived species, Thral'keth entered games as a presumed early-elimination contestant. Instead, through creative use of environmental manipulation, survived for 300 game-cycles and became one of the most-watched contestants in history.

Significance: Demonstrated that species presumed "non-viable" could generate exceptional entertainment through creativity rather than raw capability. Changed how scouts evaluated potential species.

### The Vor'enthal Thirty (Cycle 1,234,567)

Thirty members of the Vor'enthal founder species entered games voluntarily to demonstrate founder superiority after their species' prestige declined. All thirty died in the first dungeon.

Significance: Established that founder heritage didn't guarantee game success. Accelerated Vor'enthal political decline. Became a cautionary tale about arrogance.

### Kindari Memorial Subject Alpha (Cycle ~1,800,000)

The first Kindari contestant to deliberately limit their memory-sharing connections to prevent trauma transmission to their species. Survived longer than any previous Kindari by cutting themselves off from their cultural core.

Significance: Demonstrated that survival might require abandoning what makes a species what they are. Central to Liberation Collective arguments about games' corrosive nature.

### Unidentified Contestant X (Cycle Unknown)

References in Vorrax communications to a contestant who "became more than winning" appear across multiple historical periods. Whether this references one entity, multiple entities, or Vorrax metaphor is unclear.

Significance: May relate to what happens to contestants who ascend beyond normal game participation. One of many mysteries surrounding the games' ultimate purpose.

## Current Political Situation

### Old Guard Challenges

The founder coalition faces mounting pressure:
- Non-founder species demanding greater representation
- Entertainment market share erosion to Syndicate operations
- Increasing effectiveness of Liberation Collective advocacy
- Questions about the System's long-term trajectory

The Velthrani maintain dominance through institutional control, but each generation of challengers is more sophisticated than the last.

### The Human Variable

Human contestants have performed unexpectedly well in early games. Whether this represents statistical noise, genuine species potential, or something else is debated.

Factions are positioning:
- Old Guard seeks to suppress human success narratives
- Liberation Collective hopes to add human voices to abolition advocacy
- Syndicate sees investment opportunity
- Observers maintain interest for unknown reasons

The protagonist enters this political landscape as more than just a survival challenge. Every action carries factional implications whether they know it or not.

## The Great Unanswered Questions

Historical research repeatedly encounters boundaries—topics where records stop, explanations become vague, and official history contradicts itself.

**The Thirteenth Founder**: Twelve species signed the Compact, but some records reference thirteen. What happened to the thirteenth, if they existed, is unknown.

**Pre-Compact Civilizations**: The founders weren't the first substrate-capable species—they found the technology, not invented it. Who came before? Where did they go?

**The Archive's Purpose**: The System records every contestant. Why? What purpose does this serve beyond "entertainment replay"? What happens to the recorded consciousnesses?

**The Substrate Rebellion Details**: An entire stellar cluster erased, and the records are incomplete? Either the System suppresses information, or someone does.

**Ascension Destination**: Contestants who progress far enough "ascend" beyond normal participation. None have returned. What's on the other side?

These questions have haunted historians for millions of cycles. Perhaps they're unanswerable. Perhaps answers are hidden. Perhaps the answers are more dangerous than the questions.
