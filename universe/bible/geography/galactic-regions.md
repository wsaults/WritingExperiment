# Galactic Geography

The game-hosting civilization spans significant portions of the galaxy, organized into distinct regions with different political, economic, and entertainment characteristics.

---

## The Core Worlds

**Also Known As**: Founder Space, The Center, Old Territory

**Description**: The densest, oldest, and most developed region of galactic civilization. Core Worlds contain the original territories of the twelve founder species, the Consortium's central infrastructure, and the highest concentration of entertainment production facilities.

### Characteristics

**Political**: Dominated by the Old Guard faction. Founder species maintain hereditary influence. Political decisions move slowly but carry tremendous weight. The Velthrani are first among equals here.

**Economic**: Enormous wealth concentration. The entertainment industry's highest revenues flow through Core World exchanges. Currency values are pegged to Core World standards.

**Entertainment**: Premier content production. The most prestigious dungeons operate here. Contestant selection for Core World content is highly competitive—and survival rates are lower.

### Key Locations

**The Consortium Seat**: Administrative center of galactic governance. Massive station complex housing the bureaucracy that manages entertainment across civilization. Physical location of the Forum and most political infrastructure.

**Velthrani Prime System**: The Velthrani homeworld and surrounding space. Ancient, beautiful, and utterly controlled. Visitors are tolerated but never comfortable. The architecture reminds you that your species is young.

**The Archive Access Nodes**: Distributed throughout Core Worlds, these are the primary access points to the Archive (see Book 4). Heavily secured, rarely accessible to contestants.

### Dungeon Character

Core World dungeons are refined, ancient, and brutally efficient. They've been optimized over millions of cycles. Less experimental than frontier content but more consistently dangerous.

## The Syndicate Reaches

**Also Known As**: The Margins, Free Space, Opportunity Territory

**Description**: A loose collection of systems where Consortium authority is negotiable and the Horizon Syndicate holds practical power. Not lawless—but the laws are different here.

### Characteristics

**Political**: Decentralized. The Syndicate provides order through commerce rather than governance. Disputes are resolved through negotiation, bribery, or occasionally violence. Multiple power centers compete and cooperate.

**Economic**: The galaxy's most dynamic markets. Innovation thrives where regulation is light. Fortunes are made and lost rapidly. Black markets operate openly alongside legitimate trade.

**Entertainment**: Experimental content flourishes. New dungeon concepts are tested here before Core World deployment. Higher variance in quality and danger. Contestant protection standards are "flexible."

### Key Locations

**Nexus Station**: The Syndicate's largest commercial hub. A massive station where anything can be bought, sold, or traded. Multiple species, factions, and interests collide. The setting for much of Book 3's political content.

**The Free Ports**: Independent stations that maintain neutrality among factions. Refugees, criminals, entrepreneurs, and exiles mix. Each port has its own character—some orderly, some chaotic, most somewhere between.

**Human Entertainment Sector**: The region of Syndicate space where Earth-originated content is primarily distributed. Growing rapidly. Subject of intense factional competition.

### Dungeon Character

Syndicate Reaches dungeons are varied and experimental. Some are brilliant innovations; others are poorly designed cash grabs. Contestant information is better (the Syndicate sells it) but less reliable.

## The Refuge Worlds

**Also Known As**: The Outer Rim, Sanctuary Space, The Aftermath

**Description**: Territories occupied by species who were once contestants themselves—harvested, used, and eventually released as "non-viable entertainment." The Kindari are the most prominent, but dozens of species share this space.

### Characteristics

**Political**: Coalition governance based on shared trauma. The Liberation Collective originated here and remains strongest here. Decisions emphasize moral considerations over economic optimization.

**Economic**: Modest but stable. The Refuge Worlds deliberately avoid entertainment-economy dependence. Self-sufficiency is valued. Trade with other regions is carefully controlled.

**Entertainment**: Minimal. The Refuge Worlds host almost no dungeon content. This is the point—these species remember being entertainment and reject it.

### Key Locations

**Kindari Refuge Cluster**: The Kindari's primary territory. Memory Temples preserve the experiences of millions of contestants. Beautiful but haunted spaces. Visitors are welcomed but expected to understand what happened here.

**The Memorial Stations**: Space stations dedicated to preserving the memory of species that didn't survive the games. Some are museums; others are more like shrines. The Liberation Collective maintains them.

**Coalition Assembly**: The governing body of the Refuge World alliance. Less formal than the Consortium but more unified in purpose. Their voice in galactic affairs is growing.

### Dungeon Character

The Refuge Worlds don't host dungeons. When their citizens must interact with game content, they travel to other regions. This sometimes creates complications—Kindari in particular find dungeon environments psychologically distressing.

## The Quarantine Zones

**Also Known As**: The Dead Space, Forbidden Territory, The Warning

**Description**: Regions where something went catastrophically wrong. The Substrate Rebellion's aftermath. Failed experiments. Spaces where reality itself is unstable. Entry is prohibited; enforcement is lethal.

### Characteristics

**Political**: None. Quarantine Zones are excluded from all political structures. No species claims them. The Consortium maintains warning beacons and patrol vessels but doesn't govern.

**Economic**: Officially nonexistent. Unofficially, salvage operations occasionally penetrate quarantine boundaries. The rewards can be extraordinary; the risks are proportional.

**Entertainment**: Theoretically prohibited. In practice, some Quarantine Zone content exists—extreme danger, extreme ratings, extreme fatality. The System doesn't acknowledge this programming.

### Key Locations

**The Rebellion Scar**: The stellar cluster destroyed during the Substrate Rebellion. Empty in ways that violate physics. Ships that enter don't return. Something is still there—something that shouldn't be.

**Experiment Theta**: A system where a dungeon prototype went wrong. The dungeon escaped containment, consuming the system's planets. The boundary is stable but the interior is actively hostile.

**The Thirteenth Archive**: Rumored location of records pertaining to the Thirteenth Founder. Whether it exists, where exactly it might be, and what it contains are subjects of dangerous speculation.

### Dungeon Character

Quarantine Zone "dungeons" aren't dungeons in the normal sense—they're containment failures, reality breaches, and System malfunctions that have been cordoned rather than corrected. Entering them is suicide by any rational calculation.

## Regional Relationships

### Core Worlds ↔ Syndicate Reaches
Complex interdependence. The Core needs Syndicate innovation and market access; the Syndicate needs Core legitimacy and infrastructure. Tensions over regulation and control are constant.

### Core Worlds ↔ Refuge Worlds
Formal hostility masked by diplomatic necessity. The Core created the conditions the Refuge Worlds exist to escape. Political cooperation is minimal; cultural exchange is growing.

### Syndicate Reaches ↔ Refuge Worlds
Pragmatic engagement. The Syndicate will trade with anyone; the Refuge Worlds need external resources. The Liberation Collective uses Syndicate infrastructure while opposing Syndicate entertainment practices.

### All Regions ↔ Quarantine Zones
Universal avoidance. The Quarantine Zones are reminders that civilization has limits—that some experiments fail, some rebellions leave scars, and some spaces should stay empty.

## Earth's Position

Earth exists in a transitional zone between Syndicate Reaches and uncharted space. This position explains several factors:

**Syndicate Discovery**: The Syndicate identified Earth first, giving them early positioning in human entertainment markets.

**Contested Territory**: Earth's location makes it accessible to multiple factions, intensifying competition for human content rights.

**Frontier Status**: Regulations are looser, experimentation is more common, and contestant protections are weaker than Core World standards.

**Expansion Potential**: If humans prove viable long-term, Earth's region could become a significant new entertainment zone—with corresponding political implications.

## Travel and Communication

### FTL Travel
Substrate-based dimensional transit enables faster-than-light travel. Journey times scale with distance but not linearly—Core Worlds are well-connected; frontier regions require longer transits.

**Typical Transit Times**:
- Within Core Worlds: Hours to days
- Core to Syndicate Reaches: Days to weeks
- Core to Refuge Worlds: Weeks
- Anywhere to Quarantine boundaries: Weeks to months

### Communication
Quantum-entangled relay networks enable near-instantaneous communication within developed regions. Frontier areas have delays; Quarantine Zones have no legitimate communication infrastructure.

### Dungeon Transit
Dungeons exist in pocket dimensions with their own access rules. Portal networks connect dungeon entrances to regional hubs. Contestants don't usually know where their dungeon physically exists.

---

## Narrative Implications

**Book 1-2**: Marcus operates in the Syndicate Reaches / Earth sector. Frontier conditions explain regulatory gaps and experimental content.

**Book 3**: The Nexus (Syndicate hub) becomes primary setting. Regional politics come to foreground.

**Book 4**: The Archive transcends regional boundaries. Travel to Core World space becomes necessary.

**Book 5**: The Crucible exists outside normal regional classification. Stakes become galactic rather than regional.
