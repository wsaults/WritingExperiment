## Name and Symbols

**Official Name**: The Consortium of Emergent Entertainment Founding Coalition (colloquially "The Old Guard")

**Symbol**: Twelve interlocking circles of different sizes, representing the founding species. The largest circle (Velthrani) occupies the center position, though other founding species dispute this representation.

**Colors**: Gold and deep purple—the colors of established authority and ancient wealth.

**Motto**: *"Those Who Built, Shall Rule"*

## Core Philosophy

The Old Guard believes in the fundamental rightness of founder privilege. They built the System (or claim to). They established the games. They created the entertainment economy that sustains galactic civilization. Therefore, they deserve permanent preferential treatment.

This philosophy manifests as resistance to any change that threatens founder advantages:
- Opposition to contestant-rights reforms
- Protection of founder-species dungeon monopolies
- Suppression of "upstart" species success stories
- Maintenance of voting structures that guarantee founder control

They are not cartoonishly evil—they genuinely believe their stewardship benefits the galaxy. Without founder oversight, they argue, the games would devolve into chaos. Entertainment quality would collapse. Galactic civilization might fracture.

That this belief happens to justify their continued privilege is, they insist, coincidental.

## Economic Model

The Old Guard's economic power derives from three sources:

**Dungeon Monopolies**: Founders control approximately 60% of all premium dungeon operations. Non-founder species must lease rights or accept lower-tier facilities. Revenue flows upward to founder treasuries.

**Regulatory Capture**: The Old Guard dominates Consortium regulatory bodies. This allows them to set rules that favor their interests—licensing requirements that exclude competitors, quality standards only their operations can meet, etc.

**Archive Access**: The founders allegedly have preferential access to the System's Archive. If true, this gives them historical data advantage that compounds over time. They know what worked across millions of cycles; newcomers must learn through trial and error.

Combined, these advantages create a self-reinforcing loop: wealth enables political power, political power enables rule-making, rules protect wealth.

## Political Stance on Games

The Old Guard supports "traditional values" in entertainment:

- Dungeons should be challenging enough to produce casualties (good entertainment requires stakes)
- Contestants have no inherent rights beyond what the System grants (they're entertainment, not citizens)
- Species selection should prioritize established entertainment value (innovation is risky)
- The System should not be questioned or modified (it works; don't break it)

They oppose:
- Contestant welfare programs (reduce entertainment tension)
- New species harvesting quotas (dilutes exclusivity)
- Reform movements of any kind (change threatens privilege)
- Independent operators (competition reduces margins)

Their ideal game is an elegant, controlled experience that produces predictable entertainment value and reliable profit—managed by founders, for founders, with contestants as renewable resources.

## Key Species Members

**Primary**: Velthrani (dominant voice within coalition)

**Core Founders** (active in Old Guard politics):
- Keth'oran (crystalline hive-minds; control betting infrastructure)
- Thal'vex (energy beings; manage broadcast systems)
- Vor'enthal (ancient humanoids; provide diplomatic legitimacy)

**Peripheral Founders** (historically important but currently less active):
- Five additional founding species with minimal modern participation
- Some have evolved away from politics; others lost influence through internal decline

The Velthrani dominate because they've played the long game most effectively. Other founders resent this but can't organize effective opposition without breaking coalition unity—which would be worse for all of them.

## Named Representatives

**High Executor Vel'thorak**: The Old Guard's public face and political leader. A Velthrani of exceptional age and patience, Vel'thorak has managed founder politics for 50,000 cycles. His speeches emphasize tradition, stability, and the wisdom of those who built what others enjoy.

**Keth'oran-Prime**: Speaking node for the crystalline Keth'oran. Manages the faction's financial operations with machine-like precision. Has no personality that outsiders can detect, which some find more threatening than hostility.

**Ambassador Vor'enthal-Seven**: The diplomatic representative who interfaces with non-founder factions. Charming, reasonable-seeming, and utterly committed to founder privilege. Known for making oppression sound like compromise.

**The Velthrani Directorate Representative** (unnamed, rotating position): Direct link between Old Guard politics and Velthrani entertainment operations. Current occupant is particularly interested in Earth harvests.

## Relationship to Protagonist

The Old Guard represents institutional opposition to any human who succeeds beyond their designated role as brief entertainment. A human who demonstrates system mastery, exploits game mechanics creatively, or challenges established order threatens founder mythology.

They will not attack the protagonist directly—too obvious, bad optics. Instead:
- Ensure dungeon assignments are disproportionately difficult
- Coordinate sponsor hostility
- Manipulate System permissions where possible
- Apply social pressure through allied factions

Individual Old Guard representatives might develop personal animosity (especially Velthrani), but the faction's opposition is structural, not personal. The protagonist represents a *type* of threat—the upstart who doesn't know their place.

---

## Secret Agenda

The Old Guard's public agenda is their secret agenda: maintain power. However, within that, several hidden elements exist:

**Archive Knowledge**: The founders know things about the System's origins that they don't share. This knowledge may include vulnerabilities, hidden capabilities, or historical events that would undermine their legitimacy if revealed.

**The Thirteenth Founder**: Historical records reference twelve founding species, but internal Old Guard documents occasionally mention a thirteenth. What happened to them, and why this is suppressed, is one of the galaxy's most tightly held secrets.

**System Relationship**: The Old Guard may have a more complex relationship with the System itself than they admit. Some evidence suggests the System *permits* their privilege rather than being neutral—but why would it do that?

**Contingency Protocols**: The founders have plans for scenarios where their control fails. These protocols are never discussed outside the Founding Chamber. Their nature is unknown, but they're referenced with enough gravity to suggest they're significant.

---

## Narrative Function

The Old Guard serves as the face of systemic opposition—the entrenched power that the protagonist must eventually confront. They're not villains to be defeated through combat; they're an institution to be dismantled, outmaneuvered, or exposed.

Individual encounters with Old Guard representatives should feel like facing corporate lawyers, entrenched bureaucrats, and aristocrats who genuinely believe in their divine right. The protagonist can win battles; winning the war requires changing the system itself.
