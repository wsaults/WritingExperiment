## Name and Symbols

**Official Name**: The Collective for Contestant Liberation and Dignity

**Symbol**: A broken chain with a rising sun behind it—classical liberation imagery that translates across most species.

**Colors**: Sunrise orange and white—hope and purity of purpose.

**Motto**: *"Every Sapient Deserves Choice"*

---

## Core Philosophy

The Liberation Collective believes the games are fundamentally immoral. Harvesting sapient beings for entertainment, regardless of how entertaining they are, violates basic dignity rights that should be universal.

This isn't a nuanced position. They don't argue for "better conditions" or "fairer treatment"—they argue for *abolition*. No beings should be forced to participate in games. No species should be harvested. The entire entertainment economy, as currently structured, should end.

This makes them radical by galactic standards. Even sympathetic observers consider their position impractical—the entertainment economy is too entrenched, too economically essential, to simply abolish. The Collective's response: that's what everyone says about every unjust system until it falls.

---

## Economic Model

The Liberation Collective survives on idealism and spite.

**Kindari Support**: The Kindari provide the bulk of resources—their memory-sharing culture creates lasting commitment to liberation causes. Individual Kindari contribute what they can; Memory Temples provide institutional support.

**Survivor Donations**: Former contestants who escaped or were released sometimes support the Collective. These funds are unpredictable but occasionally substantial—a successful contestant might donate winnings after experiencing what the games actually are.

**Information Trade**: The Collective gathers and sells intelligence about game operations, dungeon details, and sponsor machinations. This creates ethical tension—they profit from the system they oppose—but pragmatism prevails.

**Sabotage Economy**: Some funds come from species who want games disrupted for their own reasons. The Collective accepts these alliances carefully, knowing they're being used but using the opportunity to advance their goals.

They are perpetually underfunded compared to their opposition.

---

## Political Stance on Games

The Liberation Collective's positions are uncompromising:

**Abolition**: Games should end entirely. This isn't negotiable.

**Immediate Reforms** (while working toward abolition):
- Contestant consent requirements (obvious impossibility, but stated anyway)
- Survival guarantees for contestants who request withdrawal
- Species harvesting moratoriums
- Sponsor liability for contestant deaths

**Rejected Compromises**:
- "Humane" game conditions (legitimizes the system)
- Contestant rights within games (accepts the premise that games should exist)
- Reform-from-within strategies (captured by the system they oppose)

Their political effectiveness is limited because they refuse positions that established powers might accept. This moral purity costs them influence but maintains their identity.

## Key Species Members

**Primary**: Kindari (provide moral core and institutional memory)

**Former-Contestant Coalition**:
- Species released from games after being deemed "non-viable entertainment"
- Each carries memories of what the games did to their ancestors
- United by shared trauma more than shared culture

**Sympathetic Observers**:
- Individual members of otherwise neutral species
- Some Quorathi who believe documentation should lead to action
- Occasional defectors from hostile factions (rare but significant when they occur)

**Underground Networks**:
- Contestant support operations in active game zones
- Extraction specialists who help contestants escape when possible
- Information gatherers embedded in other factions

The coalition is diverse but fragile—held together by opposition to a common enemy rather than positive shared vision.

## Named Representatives

**Voice-Coordinator Tel'vari**: A Kindari who serves as the Collective's public spokesperson. Known for emotionally devastating testimony at Consortium sessions. Has personally absorbed memories from hundreds of dead contestants.

**Escaped-Witness Kraleth**: A survivor from a species nearly exterminated in the games. Now coordinates the former-contestant coalition. Bitter, practical, and focused on results over rhetoric.

**Agent Veiled** (identity protected): The Collective's intelligence coordinator. Species unknown, background classified. Manages networks embedded throughout game operations. Some believe Veiled is multiple individuals using one identity.

**Kin'morath Partnership**: The "tarnished" Kindari who limits memory-sharing connections is an unofficial Collective asset. Not a true believer, but useful for operations that require moral flexibility.

## Relationship to Protagonist

The Liberation Collective offers genuine support—with complications.

**What They Provide**:
- Intelligence about dungeons, sponsors, and faction politics
- Network access to other sympathetic parties
- Moral witness to the protagonist's experiences
- Occasional material support when resources allow

**What They Want**:
- The protagonist's story as propaganda (suffering documented, shared, weaponized)
- Evidence of system abuses to support reform arguments
- Eventually, the protagonist's voice added to abolition advocacy
- Symbolic victories that inspire others

**The Tension**: The Collective sees the protagonist as a *cause*, not just a person. They care about human survival, but they care more about what human survival can *mean* for their movement. This creates moments where their interests diverge.

A protagonist who accepts Collective help accepts some obligation to their agenda. How much obligation, and what it costs, creates ongoing negotiation.

---

## Secret Agenda

The Liberation Collective's stated agenda *is* their agenda—they genuinely want games abolished. However, they keep secrets about methods:

**Extraction Networks**: The Collective runs more extensive contestant-extraction operations than they publicly admit. Some of these operations violate Consortium law. Exposure would destroy their legitimacy.

**Sabotage Capability**: While publicly committed to non-violence, the Collective maintains capability for disruption. They haven't used it—yet. Internal debate about when violence becomes justified is ongoing.

**Archive Project**: Some Collective members are working to access the System's Archive directly. They believe the Archive contains evidence that could delegitimize the games entirely. Whether this is possible, and what accessing it would require, is unclear.

**Hope for the System**: A minority within the Collective believes the System itself might be an ally—that it doesn't *want* to run games but is somehow compelled. They seek communication with the System independent of Consortium channels. Most Collective members consider this wishful thinking.

---

## Narrative Function

The Liberation Collective represents the moral argument against the games—the reminder that entertainment built on sapient suffering is wrong regardless of how normalized it becomes.

For the protagonist, they offer support with strings attached. They're genuine allies who also have their own agenda. Navigating this relationship requires balancing gratitude for real help with resistance to being reduced to a symbol.

They also represent hope that change is possible—that the system isn't permanent, that resistance matters, that individual survival can contribute to something larger.
