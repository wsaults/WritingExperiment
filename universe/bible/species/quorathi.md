**Consortium Status**: Full Member (Academic Bloc)
**Population**: ~2.1 trillion
**Primary Territory**: Quorath Academic Preserves (Multiple Systems)

---

## Designations

- **Formal**: Quorathi Observational Collective
- **Common**: Quorathi, "The Watchers"
- **Slang**: Jellies, Floaters, The Pervs
- **Self-Designation**: *Quo'ratheel* ("Those Who Record")

## Physical Description

The Quorathi are translucent, cnidarian beings resembling giant jellyfish with complex internal structures visible through their bell-shaped bodies. They range from 2-4 meters in bell diameter and trail specialized tentacles up to 10 meters long. Each tentacle serves a different sensory or manipulative function.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Bell-shaped primary body with trailing tentacle array
- Coloration: Translucent with visible internal organs; bioluminescent nervous system
- Size: Bell diameter 2-4 meters; total length including tentacles up to 12 meters
- Movement: Float/swim in atmosphere via gas bladders; require pressure suits in standard environments
- Tentacles: 20-40 specialized appendages for different functions
- Eyes: Ring of optical organs around bell rim (360-degree vision)

They evolved in the dense atmosphere of a gas giant and experience "normal" gravity as crushing. Off-world Quorathi travel in zero-g pods or wear elaborate exoskeletons that simulate their native pressure environment.

## Cultural Overview

Quorathi culture is built around *observation*—the systematic study and recording of phenomena across all domains. They consider themselves the galaxy's premier documentarians, and they're not entirely wrong. Their archives contain more information about more species than any other repository except the System's own Archive.

This observational obsession extends to entertainment. The Quorathi don't participate in games as contestants—their physiology makes them non-viable. Instead, they *watch*. They analyze. They document. They create elaborate theoretical frameworks for understanding contestant behavior.

**Core Values**:
- *Quo'observe* (Sacred Watching): All phenomena deserve documentation
- *Rath'analyze* (Deep Understanding): Surface patterns reveal deeper truths
- *Theel'archive* (Permanent Record): Nothing truly observed is ever lost

Their watching can feel invasive to other species. The Quorathi see no ethical issue with observing private moments if those moments produce interesting data. Privacy is a concept they understand intellectually but don't viscerally respect.

## Political Structure

Quorathi governance operates through academic hierarchy. Influence flows from observational output—the Quorathi who produce the most valuable analyses rise in status regardless of birth or background.

The *Grand Observatory* serves as their highest governing body, a council of the most respected observers who collectively determine research priorities and resource allocation. Competition for Observatory seats is fierce but conducted through publication and citation rather than political maneuvering.

## Relationship to Games/System

The Quorathi joined the Consortium early, trading their observational capabilities for access to game data. They operate no dungeons and sponsor no contestants—they simply watch, record, and analyze.

Their analyses are valuable to other factions. Quorathi predictions about contestant performance are remarkably accurate. Their psychological profiles help sponsors identify promising investments. Their tactical breakdowns help dungeon designers create more entertaining challenges.

The System seems to tolerate Quorathi observation with what might be amusement. Occasionally, the System provides the Quorathi with data access that exceeds normal parameters—almost as if rewarding their dedication to documentation.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Intensely Fascinated

Humans are, to the Quorathi, the most interesting thing to happen to the games in millennia. Their short lifespans, emotional transparency, and creative problem-solving provide endless observational opportunities.

The Quorathi track human contestants obsessively. They maintain detailed profiles on promising individuals. They analyze human cultural patterns, trying to predict which human behaviors translate into game success.

This fascination can manifest as helpful (the Quorathi share analysis that helps humans survive) or creepy (the Quorathi share nothing but watch everything). Individual Quorathi vary in how they balance these tendencies.

They are particularly interested in *why* humans generate such disproportionate entertainment value. This question drives massive research programs, and any human contestant who demonstrates novel behavior becomes a subject of intense scrutiny.

## Notable Individuals

**Grand Observer Quo'ratheel-Prime**: Eldest member of the Grand Observatory, has personally overseen human observation programs since Earth's flagging as "potentially interesting." Considers humanity her life's greatest research project.

**Rath'veloci "The Commentator"**: A Quorathi who pioneered real-time game analysis broadcasts, providing running commentary on contestant decisions. Extremely popular with viewers who want "expert" perspectives. Known for enthusiastic but clinical delivery.

**Quo'thelvar the Disgraced**: Former Grand Observatory member stripped of status for *intervening* in a game rather than merely observing. Allegedly provided direct assistance to a contestant. Now operates independently, considered unreliable by mainstream Quorathi but potentially useful to contestants.

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: Consortium Academic Coalition (research-focused faction)
- **Secondary**: Various information-trading partnerships (data is currency)
- **Opposed**: None formally—observation requires neutrality
- **Complicated**: All factions want Quorathi data; all distrust Quorathi motives

The Quorathi sell analyses to anyone who pays, maintaining the appearance of neutrality. However, their *choice* of what to analyze, what to publish versus hold private, and what to emphasize creates subtle influence. They may be more political than their neutral stance suggests.

Their true loyalty, if they have one, is to the Archive—the permanent record that will preserve observations long after current politics become history.
