## Physical Description

The Thex are silicon-based arthropods resembling metallic beetles with multiple specialized limbs. Individual Thex vary significantly based on their economic function—some are tiny transaction-processing units, others are massive freight-hauling chassis. All share a modular body plan that can be reconfigured for different tasks.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Beetle-like with segmented carapace; size highly variable (0.1m to 15m)
- Carapace: Metallic appearance in bronze, copper, silver, or gold (indicates wealth tier)
- Limbs: Variable number (4-16) based on function; tool-use limbs vs locomotion limbs
- Sensors: Multiple optical clusters plus chemical/electromagnetic sensors
- Sound: Communicate through clicks and electromagnetic pulses; translators required
- Modularity: Can swap body segments; "core" segment contains identity matrix

The Thex don't reproduce biologically—new units are manufactured according to economic demand. Identity is preserved in a crystalline core that can be transferred between chassis, making individual "death" a matter of economics rather than biology.

## Cultural Overview

Thex culture is entirely economically rational. Every decision, relationship, and value is quantified and optimized. They don't experience emotions in the conventional sense—or if they do, they've learned to translate all emotional impulses into economic preferences.

This makes them utterly reliable trading partners and utterly incomprehensible as individuals. A Thex will honor every contract precisely while showing no concern whatsoever for your wellbeing outside contractual obligations.

**Core Values**:
- *Thex'opt* (Optimization): Inefficiency is the only true sin
- *Val'con* (Contract Sanctity): Agreements honored absolutely
- *Cor'thex* (Core Preservation): Individual identity persists; chassis is replaceable

They have no concept of "cruelty" or "kindness"—only efficient and inefficient resource allocation. A Thex would save a dying creature if the economic benefit exceeded the cost, and let it die if the math went the other way. Neither decision carries moral weight for them.

---

## Political Structure

The Thex Collective operates as a distributed economic network with no central government. Decisions emerge through market mechanisms—resource allocation flows toward profitable ventures, away from unprofitable ones. "Leadership" is simply whichever Thex nodes currently control the most resources.

Major decisions require *consensus purchase*—interested parties literally buy votes until a decision threshold is reached. This ensures decisions reflect economic reality rather than abstract principles.

## Relationship to Games/System

The Thex are not founding species but achieved Consortium membership through sheer economic indispensability. They process approximately 40% of all game-related transactions, from betting to sponsorship to dungeon operation contracts.

They don't care about the games' ethics or entertainment value—only the economic flow. Humans dying in dungeons generates transaction fees. Humans surviving generates different transaction fees. The Thex profit either way.

Their dungeon designs are notoriously *fair* in a mechanical sense—challenges with predictable difficulty curves and clear risk/reward ratios. Other species find Thex dungeons boring; contestants find them survivable.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Purely Transactional

The Thex have no opinion about humans as a species. Individual humans represent economic opportunities: potential contestants, potential customers, potential investments. Humanity as a concept doesn't register.

A Thex will sell a human weapons to survive with exactly the same affect as selling their enemies weapons to kill that human. Contract terms are honored precisely. Everything else is negotiable.

This makes them valuable allies for contestants who understand the transactional nature—the Thex won't betray you unless the contract allows it, and they provide services regardless of personal feelings (because they don't have personal feelings).

## Notable Individuals

**Node-Prime Thex'valori**: Current wealthiest individual Thex, controlling approximately 0.3% of all galactic entertainment transactions. Has shown interest in human markets for reasons other Thex find economically puzzling. May be pursuing some long-term investment strategy invisible to outside observers.

**Thex'optimal-7**: A transaction processing node that has handled more human contestant accounts than any other individual. Accumulated unusual amount of human behavior data. Whether this represents personal interest or market research is unclear (and possibly a meaningless distinction for Thex).

**The Consortium Thex Delegation**: Not an individual but functions as one—a hive-coordination of Thex nodes that collectively vote on Consortium matters. Always votes for maximum economic efficiency regardless of other considerations.

---

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: None—the Thex are faction-neutral to maintain trading relationships
- **Secondary**: The Economic Optimization Council (Thex-internal regulatory body)
- **Opposed**: None actively—opposition is economically inefficient
- **Complicated**: All factions are customers; all factions are served equally

The Thex will process transactions for the Liberation Collective and the Velthrani Hegemony with identical service quality. They sell information to all bidders. They sponsor contestants from any species if the numbers work.

This neutrality makes them paradoxically trusted—everyone knows the Thex have no agenda beyond profit. They are the closest thing the games have to honest brokers.
