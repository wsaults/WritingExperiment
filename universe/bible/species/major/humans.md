# Species Profile: Humans

**Classification**: Contestant Species (Active)
**Consortium Status**: Entertainment Asset
**Population**: ~8.1 billion (pre-harvest), declining
**Primary Territory**: Earth (Sol System, now classified Game Zone)

## Designations

- **Formal**: Homo sapiens (Terran)
- **Common**: Humans, Terrans, Earthlings
- **Slang**: Squishies, Short-timers, The New Meat
- **Self-Designation**: Varies by culture (no unified term)

## Physical Description

Humans are bipedal primates averaging 1.7 meters in height, with significant variation. They possess no natural weapons, armor, or sensory advantages compared to most galactic species. Their physical durability is unremarkable.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Bilateral symmetry, upright stance, two arms, two legs
- Face: Two forward-facing eyes, flat face, expressive features
- Skin: Varies from pale to dark brown; no natural protection
- Limbs: Dexterous hands with opposable thumbs; poor natural weaponry
- Senses: Moderate visual acuity, poor hearing/smell compared to specialists
- Lifespan: 70-80 cycles without System enhancement

What makes humans notable is their *adaptability*. They lack specialization but can function adequately across wide environmental ranges and learn new skills with unusual speed. Early game data suggests this generalist capability translates into unpredictable contestant performance.

## Cultural Overview

Human culture is characterized by extreme fragmentation—thousands of languages, political systems, religions, and value frameworks coexisted before the games arrived. This diversity is both strength (varied approaches to problems) and weakness (difficulty coordinating).

Pre-harvest, humans had achieved technological civilization but had not developed substrate manipulation, FTL travel, or unified planetary governance. They had, however, developed extensive entertainment industries—a factor in their selection.

**Core Values**: Vary too much to summarize. Competition and cooperation, individualism and collectivism, tradition and innovation all coexist within the species. This internal tension produces interesting entertainment.

**Post-Harvest Reorganization**: Human society has fractured into new patterns since the games began. See [Human Settlements](../../../culture/human-settlements.md) and [Human Factions](../../../culture/human-factions.md) for detailed analysis of emergent social structures.

## Political Structure

Pre-harvest, humans organized into approximately 200 nation-states with competing interests. This political complexity has collapsed into simpler survival structures:

- **Settlement-level governance**: Fortress Communities, Nomadic Bands, Hidden Enclaves
- **Ideological factions**: Adapters, Resistance, Pragmatists, Ascendants
- **No unified human authority**: Coordination happens through trade and necessity, not institution

See [Human Settlements](../../../culture/human-settlements.md) for settlement governance patterns.
See [Human Factions](../../../culture/human-factions.md) for ideological alignments.

## Relationship to Games/System

Humans were harvested recently—within the last few cycles by galactic standards. Earth's transformation into an active Game Zone is still ongoing, with new dungeons spawning regularly.

**Selection Factors**:
- Rapid technological development indicated adaptive cognition
- Persistent internal conflict suggested entertainment potential
- Electromagnetic broadcasts (television, radio) demonstrated entertainment capacity
- Cultural diversity promised varied contestant approaches

**Performance to Date**: Statistically unremarkable overall, but with notable outliers. Human creativity in exploiting game mechanics has drawn sponsor interest. Whether this represents genuine species potential or statistical noise remains debated.

**System Relationship**: Humans were not consulted about participation. Most survivors view the System with hostility, fear, or reluctant accommodation. A minority (Ascendants) have developed spiritual frameworks incorporating System existence.

## Attitude Toward Other Species

**Classification**: Variable/Distrustful

Pre-harvest, humans had no confirmed contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Post-harvest, they've encountered multiple alien species under circumstances designed to entertain rather than educate.

General patterns:
- **Toward Sympathetic Species** (Kindari): Cautious gratitude; confusion about alien motivation
- **Toward Hostile Species** (Velthrani, Old Guard): Fear, hatred, desire for revenge
- **Toward Neutral Species** (Quorathi): Suspicion; awareness of being observed
- **Toward Fellow Contestants**: Complex; competition and solidarity coexist

Humans retain species-centric thinking, viewing humanity's survival as primary. Whether they develop broader galactic consciousness depends on future events.

## Notable Individuals

**Marcus Reeves**: Series protagonist. Systems architect whose analytical approach to dungeon mechanics has produced unexpected survival outcomes. See [Protagonist Profile](../../../characters/protagonist.md).

## Faction Affiliations

Human-level factions (internal to the species):
- **Adapters**: Embrace System, pursue advancement
- **Resistance**: Oppose game participation
- **Pragmatists**: Focus on survival
- **Ascendants**: Seek transcendence through games

See [Human Factions](../../../culture/human-factions.md) for detailed profiles.

Galactic faction relationships:
- **Natural Ally**: Liberation Collective (shared interest in contestant welfare)
- **Potential Ally**: Horizon Syndicate (transactional relationship possible)
- **Opposed**: Old Guard/Consortium (harvested by them)
- **Complicated**: The Observers (unknown agenda; interested in humans)

---

## Narrative Function

Humans serve as audience entry point into the galactic entertainment ecosystem. Their perspective—recently harvested, still processing the reality of their situation—mirrors the reader's discovery of the universe.

Their adaptability and creativity provide narrative justification for protagonist success against established species. Their fragmentation provides internal conflict and varied supporting characters. Their recent harvest means mysteries about the games can be discovered alongside them.
