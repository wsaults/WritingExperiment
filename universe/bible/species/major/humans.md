## Designations

- **Formal**: Homo sapiens (Terran)
- **Common**: Humans, Terrans, Earthlings
- **Slang**: Squishies, Short-timers, The New Meat
- **Self-Designation**: Varies by culture (no unified term)

## Physical Description

Humans are bipedal primates averaging 1.7 meters in height, with significant variation. They possess no natural weapons, armor, or sensory advantages compared to most galactic species. Their physical durability is unremarkable.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Bilateral symmetry, upright stance, two arms, two legs
- Face: Two forward-facing eyes, flat face, expressive features
- Skin: Varies from pale to dark brown; no natural protection
- Limbs: Dexterous hands with opposable thumbs; poor natural weaponry
- Senses: Moderate visual acuity, poor hearing/smell compared to specialists
- Lifespan: 70-80 cycles without System enhancement

What makes humans notable is their *adaptability*. They lack specialization but can function adequately across wide environmental ranges and learn new skills with unusual speed. Early game data suggests this generalist capability translates into unpredictable contestant performance.

## Cultural Overview

Human culture is characterized by extreme fragmentation—thousands of languages, political systems, religions, and value frameworks coexisted before the games arrived. This diversity is both strength (varied approaches to problems) and weakness (difficulty coordinating).

Pre-harvest, humans had achieved technological civilization but had not developed substrate manipulation, FTL travel, or unified planetary governance. They had, however, developed extensive entertainment industries—a factor in their selection.

**Core Values**: Vary too much to summarize. Competition and cooperation, individualism and collectivism, tradition and innovation all coexist within the species. This internal tension produces interesting entertainment.

**Post-Harvest Reorganization**: Human society has fractured into new patterns since the games began. See [Human Settlements](../../../culture/human-settlements.md) and [Human Factions](../../../culture/human-factions.md) for detailed analysis of emergent social structures.

---

## Political Structure

Pre-harvest, humans organized into approximately 200 nation-states with competing interests. This political complexity has collapsed into simpler survival structures:

- **Settlement-level governance**: Fortress Communities, Nomadic Bands, Hidden Enclaves
- **Ideological factions**: Adapters, Resistance, Pragmatists, Ascendants
- **No unified human authority**: Coordination happens through trade and necessity, not institution

See [Human Settlements](../../../culture/human-settlements.md) for settlement governance patterns.
See [Human Factions](../../../culture/human-factions.md) for ideological alignments.

## Relationship to Games/System

Humans were harvested recently—within the last few cycles by galactic standards. Earth's transformation into an active Game Zone is still ongoing, with new dungeons spawning regularly.

**Selection Factors**:
- Rapid technological development indicated adaptive cognition
- Persistent internal conflict suggested entertainment potential
- Electromagnetic broadcasts (television, radio) demonstrated entertainment capacity
- Cultural diversity promised varied contestant approaches

**Performance to Date**: Statistically unremarkable overall, but with notable outliers. Human creativity in exploiting game mechanics has drawn sponsor interest. Whether this represents genuine species potential or statistical noise remains debated.

**System Relationship**: Humans were not consulted about participation. Most survivors view the System with hostility, fear, or reluctant accommodation. A minority (Ascendants) have developed spiritual frameworks incorporating System existence.

---

## Attitude Toward Other Species

**Classification**: Variable/Distrustful

Pre-harvest, humans had no confirmed contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Post-harvest, they've encountered multiple alien species under circumstances designed to entertain rather than educate.

General patterns:
- **Toward Sympathetic Species** (Kindari): Cautious gratitude; confusion about alien motivation
- **Toward Hostile Species** (Velthrani, Old Guard): Fear, hatred, desire for revenge
- **Toward Neutral Species** (Quorathi): Suspicion; awareness of being observed
- **Toward Fellow Contestants**: Complex; competition and solidarity coexist

Humans retain species-centric thinking, viewing humanity's survival as primary. Whether they develop broader galactic consciousness depends on future events.

## Faction Affiliations

Human-level factions (internal to the species):
- **Adapters**: Embrace System, pursue advancement
- **Resistance**: Oppose game participation
- **Pragmatists**: Focus on survival
- **Ascendants**: Seek transcendence through games

See [Human Factions](../../../culture/human-factions.md) for detailed profiles.

Galactic faction relationships:
- **Natural Ally**: Liberation Collective (shared interest in contestant welfare)
- **Potential Ally**: Horizon Syndicate (transactional relationship possible)
- **Opposed**: Old Guard/Consortium (harvested by them)
- **Complicated**: The Observers (unknown agenda; interested in humans)

## Galactic Perception

How the galaxy views humans—not as they are, but as they *appear* to ancient, long-lived species watching them struggle:

### The Mayfly Appeal

Humans live approximately 70-80 cycles without System enhancement—barely noticeable by Velthrani or Quorathi standards. A Velthrani elder might have watched a hundred human generations rise and fall before breakfast.

This brevity makes humans *urgent*. They don't deliberate; they *act*. They don't accumulate wisdom over millennia; they make decisions with incomplete information and deal with consequences they won't live to fully understand. For species who measure choices in centuries, this recklessness is both horrifying and fascinating.

Entertainment analysts call it "mayfly appeal"—the compelling nature of watching creatures who can't afford to wait.

### Emotional Transparency

Most galactic species have developed emotional control over evolutionary timescales. Humans have not. They broadcast their internal states through facial expressions, voice modulation, body language, and biochemical signals they can't suppress.

For viewers, this is *riveting*. Humans can't hide when they're afraid, angry, hopeful, or broken. Every emotion plays across their faces in real-time. Long-lived species find this nakedness almost indecent—and impossible to look away from.

The Kindari recognize this vulnerability immediately. The Velthrani consider it a weakness. Sponsors consider it excellent content.

### The Narrative Instinct

Before harvest, humans produced more entertainment content per capita than any pre-contact civilization on record. They told stories about themselves *constantly*—through broadcast, print, digital, oral tradition. They couldn't stop narrativizing their existence.

This instinct survives into the games. Human contestants don't just fight; they frame their experiences as stories with themselves as protagonists. They name their enemies. They declare intentions. They seek dramatic moments.

Some analysts believe this is why humans produce statistical outliers—they're not just trying to survive, they're trying to make their survival *mean something*. This creates unpredictable risk-taking that either kills them quickly or produces spectacular results.

### Entertainment Value Assessment

**Consortium Rating**: Grade A Prospects (Developing)

**Appeal Factors**:
- High emotional expressiveness (viewer engagement)
- Short lifespans (compressed dramatic arcs)
- Species diversity (varied contestant approaches)
- Narrative tendency (self-generating storylines)
- Underdog positioning (dramatic tension)

**Detracting Factors**:
- Fragile (high mortality reduces long-term investment)
- Unpredictable (difficult to script)
- Resentful (negative attitude toward System reduces cooperation)

**Sponsor Interest**: Moderate to High. Human contestants attract sponsors who appreciate volatility and dramatic potential over consistent performance. The "betting on a longshot" narrative has proven popular with certain viewer demographics.

**Viewer Demographics**: Humans particularly appeal to:
- Kindari (empathy response)
- Younger Quorathi (thesis subject material)
- Consortium fringe markets (novelty appeal)
- Horizon Syndicate viewers (gambling opportunities)

## Narrative Function

Humans serve as audience entry point into the galactic entertainment ecosystem. Their perspective—recently harvested, still processing the reality of their situation—mirrors the reader's discovery of the universe.

Their adaptability and creativity provide narrative justification for protagonist success against established species. Their fragmentation provides internal conflict and varied supporting characters. Their recent harvest means mysteries about the games can be discovered alongside them.
