## Physical Description

The Kindari resemble large, luminescent moths with humanoid torsos emerging from thorax segments. They average 1.6 meters tall in resting posture but can extend to 2.1 meters when their wings fully unfurl. Their bodies emit soft bioluminescence that shifts with emotional state—a trait they cannot fully control.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Moth-like lower body, humanoid upper torso
- Wings: Four primary wings with intricate patterns unique to each individual; span ~3 meters
- Face: Large compound eyes (iridescent purple), small mouth, expressive antennae
- Skin: Covered in fine, downy fur ranging from silver to deep blue
- Limbs: Two humanoid arms (delicate), six small legs for ground locomotion
- Light: Bioluminescent patches on wings and torso; color indicates mood

Their wing patterns serve as identity markers—no two Kindari share identical patterns, and these patterns are legally protected across Consortium space. Forging a wing pattern is one of the few crimes the Kindari prosecute aggressively.

## Cultural Overview

Kindari culture centers on *collective memory*—the practice of experiencing and preserving significant moments across generations. They can share memories directly through antenna contact, and their most sacred institutions are Memory Temples where important experiences are preserved for all Kindari to access.

This practice gives them an unusual relationship with suffering. The Kindari don't merely know that the games cause pain—they have *felt* it, through memories shared by their ancestors who were once contestants themselves.

**Core Values**:
- *Kin'mem* (Shared Burden): Pain experienced together is pain reduced
- *Var'kin* (Witness Obligation): All suffering must be remembered
- *Tel'dari* (Gentle Persistence): Change comes slowly but inevitably

The Kindari are pacifists by cultural necessity—their memory-sharing means violence perpetrated by one Kindari is felt by all. They developed non-violent resistance into an art form during their own historical oppression.

## Political Structure

The Kindari have no government in the conventional sense. Decisions emerge through *memory consensus*—sharing relevant memories until a collective understanding forms. This process is slow by most species' standards but produces remarkably stable outcomes.

Their interface with galactic politics is managed by the *Voice Choir*—selected individuals who can tolerate extended contact with non-Kindari without emotional contamination. Voice Choir members often suffer from long-term psychological effects and are honored as sacrifice-makers.

## Relationship to Games/System

The Kindari were harvested for the games approximately 400,000 cycles ago. Their performance as contestants was... unusual. They couldn't stop themselves from sharing pain with each other, which meant every Kindari death reverberated through the entire population.

The Consortium eventually classified them as "non-viable entertainment" and released them—but not before enough memories accumulated to permanently shape Kindari culture. They *remember* what it means to be contestants.

Today, they occupy observer status in the Consortium, advocating for contestant welfare without voting power to actually change anything. Most other species consider them annoying idealists.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Sympathetic/Protective

The Kindari are among the few species actively working to help human contestants. They can't stop the games—they've tried—but they channel resources toward support networks, information sharing, and sponsor advocacy.

Their sympathy comes from recognition. They see in humans the same desperate creativity they themselves displayed during their harvesting period. They remember being the entertainment, and they cannot watch it happen to another species without trying to help.

This makes them valuable allies but sometimes frustrating ones. Kindari assistance often comes wrapped in emotional processing that humans find uncomfortable. They want to *share* the experience, not just provide material aid.

## Notable Individuals

**Vara'kindel the Keeper**: Elder of the Primary Memory Temple, holding the most complete record of Kindari game experiences. Has controversially argued for sharing these memories with human contestants to help them prepare.

**Tel'vareen of the Voice Choir**: Lead advocate for human welfare in Consortium observer sessions. Known for emotional testimony that moves some species and annoys many others.

**Kin'morath "The Tarnished"**: A Kindari who has deliberately limited memory-sharing connections to operate more effectively among other species. Works as an independent contractor, often assisting human contestants—for fees, not purely altruistic reasons. Considered damaged by mainstream Kindari culture.

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: The Liberation Collective (contestant-rights faction)
- **Secondary**: Consortium Observer Coalition (non-voting species alliance)
- **Opposed**: All founding species factions (historical antagonism)
- **Complicated**: Various reformist movements (allies but more moderate)

The Kindari are reliable advocates for any proposal that would improve contestant conditions. They lack the power to force change but provide moral legitimacy and information networks that more powerful factions sometimes find useful.
