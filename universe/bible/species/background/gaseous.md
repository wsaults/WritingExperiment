Species in this file are Tier 3 (brief reference) entries for scene population and variety.

Includes: Atmospheric, nebular, non-corporeal biology types.

## 1. Mistral

**Biology**: Sentient wind currents
**Classification**: Wildcard
**Appearance**: Visible only by what they move—dust, debris, loose objects. 2-5m across depending on emotional state. Voice sounds like wind through pipes. Leave cold trails.
**Culture**: Freedom-obsessed. Consider walls and containers obscene. Travel constantly. Form temporary communities like storm fronts, then disperse. Agreements are "wind contracts"—unenforceable but traditional.
**Narrative Use**: Invisible guides; environmental hazards; dramatic entrances; scattered documents; unpredictable allies.
**Quick Hook**: "The Mistral's voice came from everywhere—a whisper that somehow carried perfectly. 'Walls offend us. You want help? Open a window. Several windows. All of them.'"

## 2. Nebulan

**Biology**: Nebular gas cloud
**Classification**: Sympathetic
**Appearance**: Vast, colorful clouds of interstellar gas. Natural state is kilometers across; compress to 3-5m for interaction. Internal lights flicker like distant stars. Beautiful and slow.
**Culture**: Deep thinkers operating on cosmic timescales. Conversations with them take hours—single words emerge gradually. Patient allies who've been waiting for interesting things to happen for millennia.
**Narrative Use**: Cosmic perspective; slow reveals; beautiful environments; ancient knowledge; patience tests.
**Quick Hook**: "The Nebulan's colors shifted through an hour of contemplation before their answer arrived: 'Ye... ... ...es.' I didn't have time to wait for elaboration."

## 3. Fumerex

**Biology**: Toxic gas composite
**Classification**: Hostile
**Appearance**: Roiling clouds of acrid, poisonous gas. 2-3m across. Yellow-green coloration, visible fumes. Smell precedes them—sulfur, chlorine, worse. Awareness visible as denser cores within the cloud.
**Culture**: Believe clean air is unnatural. Spread pollution as religious duty. Consider oxygen-breathers fragile and amusing. Not evil—just operating on fundamentally incompatible survival parameters.
**Narrative Use**: Environmental hazards; gas mask requirements; poison clouds in combat; terraforming conflicts; breathing-related drama.
**Quick Hook**: "The Fumerex drifted closer, and my eyes began to water. 'Your atmosphere,' they gurgled, 'is so *thin*. How do you survive in this... this *nothing*?'"

## 4. Cyroform

**Biology**: Frozen gas (cryogenic)
**Classification**: Neutral
**Appearance**: Clouds of supercooled gas, 1.5-2m across. Leave frost trails. Ice crystals form and fall within their mass like internal snow. Temperature drops dramatically in their presence.
**Culture**: Preservation-focused. Consider change a tragedy. Archive everything by freezing it. Excellent at keeping secrets—literally frozen in place until needed.
**Narrative Use**: Cold environments; preservation/stasis; frozen information; temperature puzzles; hypothermia threats.
**Quick Hook**: "The Cyroform's presence dropped the temperature thirty degrees. 'We keep things,' they said, ice forming on the words themselves. 'Safe. Frozen. Forever.'"

## 5. Pyrovapor

**Biology**: Superheated gas
**Classification**: Wildcard
**Appearance**: Shimmering heat-clouds, 2-3m across. Air warps around them. Can briefly ignite into visible flame when agitated. Temperature indicates mood—warm is friendly, scorching is not.
**Culture**: Passion-driven. Emotions run hot—literally. Quick to anger, quick to forgive, quick to everything. Consider cold beings tragic and pitiable. Burn things accidentally during emotional conversations.
**Narrative Use**: Fire hazards; emotional encounters; heat sources; explosive temperaments; warmth in cold situations.
**Quick Hook**: "The Pyrovapor's edges flickered to actual flame—embarrassment, I later learned. 'Sorry about your eyebrows,' they said. 'I get *excited*.'"

## 6. Aerith

**Biology**: Pure atmospheric gases
**Classification**: Sympathetic
**Appearance**: Gentle, nearly invisible beings—detectable by slight air pressure differences. 1-2m across. Prefer to remain unseen. Voice like sighing wind.
**Culture**: Observers and listeners. Exist in the spaces between other beings. Hear everything, remember everything, share nothing without trust. Perfect spies, but refuse payment—information is relationship, not commodity.
**Narrative Use**: Invisible observers; overheard secrets; gentle allies; air-based communication; surveillance detection.
**Quick Hook**: "I didn't notice the Aerith until they spoke—a breath beside my ear. 'We've been listening,' they sighed. 'You're interesting. We'll keep your secrets. Most of them.'"

## 7. Miasmath

**Biology**: Mathematical pattern gas
**Classification**: Neutral
**Appearance**: Swirling clouds that form geometric patterns—fractals, spirals, perfect shapes. 1-2m across. Colors shift in mathematical progressions. Presence feels orderly, calming, slightly unsettling.
**Culture**: Pure logic made gaseous. Communicate in patterns and ratios. Consider chaos offensive. Help solve problems by literally becoming the solution—forming answer-shapes in their gas.
**Narrative Use**: Puzzles; logic challenges; pattern recognition; mathematical communication; orderly environments.
**Quick Hook**: "The Miasmath swirled into a shape I almost recognized—a formula, rendered in gas. 'The answer,' they announced, reforming into something more complex, 'is self-evident. You simply aren't *looking* correctly.'"

## 8. Vaporis

**Biology**: Water vapor consciousness
**Classification**: Sympathetic
**Appearance**: Clouds of warm, humid mist, 1.5-2m across. Condensation forms faces temporarily before dissolving. Leave surfaces damp. Soothing presence.
**Culture**: Nurturers. Associated with hot springs, steam baths, comfort. Help beings relax, recover, think clearly. Consider stress a form of illness they can treat. Sometimes overwhelming in their care.
**Narrative Use**: Healing environments; relaxation scenes; steam rooms; humidity-based hazards; nurturing allies; spa encounters.
**Quick Hook**: "The Vaporis enveloped me before I could protest. Warm, humid, *insistent*. 'You are stressed,' they observed. 'Let us help. We always help. You cannot refuse help.'"
