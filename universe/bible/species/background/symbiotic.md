## 1. Duosynth

**Biology**: Binary organism (pilot/vessel)
**Classification**: Neutral
**Appearance**: Large, slow-moving "vessels" (2-3m, vaguely slug-like) carrying small, brilliant "pilots" (0.3m, insectoid). Pilots provide direction and intelligence; vessels provide mobility and strength. Cannot survive separation.
**Culture**: Perfect partnerships. Consider solo beings tragic and incomplete. Obsessed with finding "the right match." Arranged bondings are their most sacred institution. Divorce is literally fatal.
**Narrative Use**: Partnership dynamics; arranged relationship commentary; separation threats; carrying capacity; two minds one body puzzles.
**Quick Hook**: "The Duosynth pilot clicked from its perch atop the vessel. 'We disagree,' the pilot said. 'We agree,' rumbled the vessel. 'See? Perfect harmony.'"

## 2. Lichori

**Biology**: Mutualistic composite (fungus/algae)
**Classification**: Sympathetic
**Appearance**: Humanoid beings made of intertwined fungal and algal growth. 1.5m tall. Surface patterns shift as internal partners negotiate. Color indicates dominant partner (green = algae, grey = fungus).
**Culture**: Consensus society. Every individual is already a negotiation between two organisms. Decisions require internal agreement before external action. Patient, deliberate, excellent mediators.
**Narrative Use**: Internal conflict made visible; meditation on compromise; slow but reliable allies; biological metaphors.
**Quick Hook**: "The Lichori's colors shifted—argument in progress. Finally, they settled on grey-green. 'We have reached... agreement,' they said. 'Partial agreement. Acceptable agreement. Proceed.'"

## 3. Parasitori

**Biology**: Parasitic controller
**Classification**: Hostile
**Appearance**: Small, worm-like organisms (5cm) that bond with host nervous systems. Hosts appear normal except for slightly glassy eyes and periodic twitches. Hosts retain awareness—they just can't control themselves.
**Culture**: Riders. Consider hosts "vehicles" rather than people. Trade hosts like others trade ships. Some hosts are passed down through generations of Parasitori families. Genuinely don't understand why this bothers other species.
**Narrative Use**: Body horror; loss of control; hidden enemies; "is this person compromised?" tension; rescue scenarios.
**Quick Hook**: "The human smiled, but the movement was wrong—too smooth, too practiced. 'I assure you,' they said, 'everything is normal.' Behind their eyes, something else was driving."

## 4. Commensari

**Biology**: Colony organism (hundreds of tiny individuals)
**Classification**: Neutral
**Appearance**: Swarms of rice-sized organisms that collectively form humanoid shapes. 1.5-2m when assembled. Can separate and reform. Individual components unintelligent; collective consciousness emerges from numbers.
**Culture**: Democracy taken literally. Every decision requires majority agreement from thousands of components. Slow to decide, impossible to bribe (too many voters). Dissenting components sometimes leave to form splinter colonies.
**Narrative Use**: Collective decision-making; political commentary; dispersal/reassembly mechanics; voting humor.
**Quick Hook**: "The Commensari rippled—internal vote in progress. 'The ayes have it,' they announced. 'By 847 to 831. Motion carries. We will... help you. Narrowly.'"

## 5. Mycelith

**Biology**: Networked collective (root system consciousness)
**Classification**: Sympathetic
**Appearance**: What appears to be multiple individuals—humanoid mushroom-forms, 1.2-1.5m tall—is actually one being connected by underground mycelium networks. "Individuals" are fruiting bodies; true self is the network.
**Culture**: Patience and connection. Consider separation the true death. Communicate through chemical signals that take time to propagate. Excellent at long-term planning, terrible at emergencies.
**Narrative Use**: Network infiltration/communication; plant-based environments; long-term ally setup; slow reveal of true scale; horror of discovering the forest is ONE being.
**Quick Hook**: "I talked to three Mycelith that day, in three different locations. It wasn't until later I realized they'd all said the same thing—at exactly the same time. Same being. Same network. Same unsettling smile."
