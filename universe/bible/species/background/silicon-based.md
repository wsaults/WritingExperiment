## 1. Lithori

**Biology**: Crystalline (quartz-based)
**Classification**: Neutral
**Appearance**: Humanoid figures composed of interlocking quartz crystals. 1.5-2m tall. Facets catch light, creating rainbow refractions. No facial features—communicate through harmonic vibrations.
**Culture**: Resonance-based society. Decisions made through harmonic consensus—literally singing until frequencies align. Patience measured in geological time.
**Narrative Use**: Communication barriers; ancient witnesses; beautiful but alien encounters; harmonic puzzles.
**Quick Hook**: "The Lithori's crystals hummed at a frequency that made my teeth ache. My translator struggled: 'We... await... alignment. Your haste... discordant.'"

## 2. Ferrix

**Biology**: Metallic (iron-based)
**Classification**: Wildcard
**Appearance**: Dense humanoids of living iron, 1.8m tall. Rust-red to polished silver depending on mood/health. Magnetic fields visible as faint aurora around them.
**Culture**: Magnetic hierarchy—leaders literally attract followers. Contracts sealed by touching, creating temporary magnetic bonds. Oxidation is their aging.
**Narrative Use**: Magnetic hazards; technological interference; rust as disease/death; unusual romance (attraction jokes).
**Quick Hook**: "The Ferrix extended a hand, and every metal object in the room shivered toward them. 'Careful,' they rumbled. 'I am... attractive... when emotional.'"

## 3. Obsidari

**Biology**: Volcanic glass
**Classification**: Hostile
**Appearance**: Sharp-edged humanoids of black volcanic glass. 1.6m tall. Edges catch light like obsidian blades. Move with dangerous fluidity, leaving glass shards in their wake.
**Culture**: Shatter-based death cult. Believe breaking is transcendence. Create beautiful destruction. Fragments of dead Obsidari incorporated into living ones.
**Narrative Use**: Assassins; environmental hazards; beautiful but deadly; tragic enemies; valuable remains.
**Quick Hook**: "The Obsidari smiled—a crack spreading across their face. 'All things break,' they whispered. 'We simply... embrace it.'"

## 4. Geothrix

**Biology**: Living stone (granite composite)
**Classification**: Sympathetic
**Appearance**: Massive, boulder-like beings, 2-3m tall. Craggy features suggest faces. Move slowly but with immense strength. Moss and lichen often grow on them.
**Culture**: Patient guardians. Protect locations for millennia. Consider rapid movement rude. Deep, slow voices like grinding stone.
**Narrative Use**: Ancient protectors; immovable obstacles; slow allies; geological knowledge; comic slowness.
**Quick Hook**: "The Geothrix turned—a process that took several minutes. 'You... are... in... a... hurry,' they observed. Another minute passed. 'Why?'"

## 5. Crysthari

**Biology**: Gemstone (multi-faceted)
**Classification**: Neutral
**Appearance**: Elegant humanoids composed of precious gemstones. 1.4-1.7m tall. Each individual's composition unique—ruby hearts, sapphire eyes, emerald veins.
**Culture**: Value-obsessed society where worth is literally visible. Social hierarchy based on gem composition. Emeralds outrank rubies, diamonds above all.
**Narrative Use**: Wealth indicators; social commentary; valuable targets; beautiful NPCs; class conflict.
**Quick Hook**: "The Crysthari's diamond eyes appraised me. 'Carbon-based,' they noted, with the tone one reserves for finding mud on one's shoes. 'How... common.'"

## 6. Pumicari

**Biology**: Volcanic rock (porous stone)
**Classification**: Sympathetic
**Appearance**: Lightweight, porous beings full of gas pockets. 1.5m tall. Float in water, bounce when dropped. Surprisingly cheerful despite looking like walking volcanic debris.
**Culture**: Adaptable drifters. Go where currents take them. No permanent settlements. Philosophy of accepting whatever comes. Literally and figuratively light-hearted.
**Narrative Use**: Guides; refugees; philosophical counterpoints; floating transport; comic relief.
**Quick Hook**: "The Pumicari bobbed in the water, grinning. 'Current takes us where current takes us,' they said. 'Why fight the flow? You sink. We float.'"

---

## 7. Stalactari

**Biology**: Mineral deposit (cave formations)
**Classification**: Neutral
**Appearance**: Elongated beings resembling cave formations. 1-2m depending on age. Grow downward from ceilings in natural state. Adapted bipedal form for interaction.
**Culture**: Drip-based communication—patience and persistence. Growth-obsessed. Measure worth by accumulated mineral layers. Never rush.
**Narrative Use**: Underground guides; time-based puzzles; patient allies; cave environments; growth metaphors.
**Quick Hook**: "The Stalactari considered my question. A drop of mineral-rich water fell from their forehead. 'In time,' they said. Another drop. 'All answers... come.'"

## 8. Magnetari

**Biology**: Living lodestone
**Classification**: Wildcard
**Appearance**: Dense, dark humanoids crackling with magnetic energy. 1.5m tall. Metal objects orbit them. Eyes glow with electromagnetic radiation.
**Culture**: Polarity-based society. Opposites attract—literally pair-bond through magnetic opposition. Same-polarity individuals repel and cannot share space.
**Narrative Use**: Technology disruption; forced separation scenarios; unusual relationships; compass/navigation; hazardous encounters.
**Quick Hook**: "The two Magnetari tried to approach each other and were flung apart. 'Same polarity,' one sighed. 'We can only be together... by being apart.'"

---

## 9. Sedimentari

**Biology**: Layered rock (sedimentary composite)
**Classification**: Sympathetic
**Appearance**: Stratified beings showing visible geological history. 1.8m tall. Each layer represents a different era of growth. Reading their layers reveals their past.
**Culture**: History-obsessed. Identity is literally visible. Cannot lie about their past—it's written in their strata. Archivists and witnesses.
**Narrative Use**: Living records; truth verification; historical exposition; emotional reveals (trauma visible as dark layers).
**Quick Hook**: "The Sedimentari's layers told their story—bright bands of joy, dark compression of grief. 'You want my history?' they asked. 'Look closer.'"

## 10. Marbleth

**Biology**: Metamorphic (pressure-formed)
**Classification**: Neutral
**Appearance**: Smooth, veined beings of living marble. 1.6-1.9m tall. Patterns unique to each individual like fingerprints. Surprisingly warm to touch despite stone composition.
**Culture**: Pressure creates perfection. Hardship is celebrated as transformation. Scars (cracks) are marks of honor. Sculptors and philosophers.
**Narrative Use**: Artists; philosophical conversations; beauty from suffering; valuable statuary; refined culture.
**Quick Hook**: "The Marbleth traced the crack running through their chest. 'This is where I became beautiful,' they said. 'Pressure. Heat. Becoming. You understand?'"
