# Background Species: Energy-Based

Species in this file are Tier 3 (brief reference) entries for scene population and variety.

Includes: Plasma, electromagnetic, photonic biology types.

## 1. Solari

**Biology**: Solar plasma
**Classification**: Sympathetic
**Appearance**: Humanoid shapes of contained solar fire. 1.5-2m tall. Corona flares for hair, sunspot-dark eyes. Radiate warmth and visible light. Must dim themselves for close interaction.
**Culture**: Light-givers. Consider darkness a tragedy to be corrected. Generous to a fault, sometimes overwhelming. "Too much help" is a common complaint from their allies.
**Narrative Use**: Light sources; warmth in cold environments; overwhelming generosity; sunburn jokes; energy sources.
**Quick Hook**: "The Solari dimmed apologetically as my skin began to redden. 'Sorry! Sorry! I forget you... cook.' They dimmed further. 'Is this better? I can do less. I can always do less.'"

## 2. Voidling

**Biology**: Negative energy
**Classification**: Hostile
**Appearance**: Humanoid absences—shapes where light doesn't exist. 1.7m tall. Looking at them hurts; they're gaps in reality. Edges shimmer where existence meets non-existence.
**Culture**: Entropy worshippers. Believe the universe tends toward darkness, and they're helping. Not malicious exactly—just absolutely convinced everything should stop existing.
**Narrative Use**: Existential horror; light-based puzzles; philosophical antagonists; disturbing encounters.
**Quick Hook**: "The Voidling spoke, and its words left silence behind them—not quiet, but *absence*. 'All light fails,' it said. 'We are simply... patient.'"

## 3. Pulsar

**Biology**: Rotating electromagnetic
**Classification**: Wildcard
**Appearance**: Spinning forms of directed energy, 1-1.5m diameter. Emit regular pulses of light. Rotation speed indicates mood—faster means agitated. Difficult to look at directly.
**Culture**: Rhythm-obsessed. Communication through pulse patterns. Consider irregular beings (like organics) deeply unsettling. Predictability is their highest value.
**Narrative Use**: Timing puzzles; communication barriers; navigation beacons; strobe effects in combat.
**Quick Hook**: "The Pulsar's rotation stuttered when it saw me. *flash-flash-flash-pause-flash*. My translator guessed: 'You... have no rhythm? How do you... exist?'"

## 4. Thermari

**Biology**: Pure heat
**Classification**: Neutral
**Appearance**: Shimmer-forms visible only through heat distortion. 1.5-2m tall. No color, no shape—just the bending of light and the sensation of warmth. Leave scorch marks when emotional.
**Culture**: Temperature-based communication. Hot means agreement, cold means rejection. Moderate warmth is polite neutrality. Handshakes can be dangerous.
**Narrative Use**: Invisible threats; heat-based puzzles; uncomfortable negotiations; fire hazards; sauna jokes.
**Quick Hook**: "I knew the Thermari agreed when the room temperature rose twenty degrees. 'We have... accord,' they said, as my water glass began to steam."

## 5. Photosynth

**Biology**: Living light patterns
**Classification**: Sympathetic
**Appearance**: Complex interference patterns of self-sustaining light. 1-2m tall. Colors shift constantly like oil on water. Can reshape themselves at will but prefer humanoid forms for diplomacy.
**Culture**: Art-obsessed. Consider their own existence an aesthetic statement. Constantly redesigning themselves. Fashion-conscious to an exhausting degree.
**Narrative Use**: Beautiful encounters; artistic commentary; light shows; vain allies; disguise capabilities.
**Quick Hook**: "The Photosynth reformed three times during our conversation, each iteration more elaborate. 'This isn't vanity,' they insisted, adding another color layer. 'This is *identity*.'"

## 6. Staticari

**Biology**: Electrical fields
**Classification**: Wildcard
**Appearance**: Humanoid clouds of crackling static electricity. 1.6-1.8m tall. Hair-like tendrils of lightning. Touch them and you get shocked—the strength indicates their feelings about you.
**Culture**: Charge-based honesty. Literally cannot lie—their fields reveal emotional states. Consider deception a physical impossibility. Deeply confused by organic subterfuge.
**Narrative Use**: Truth detection; electrical hazards; technology interaction; hair-raising encounters; shocking revelations (pun intended).
**Quick Hook**: "The Staticari reached toward me. I flinched. 'Don't worry,' they crackled. 'If I hated you, you'd know. You'd be unconscious, but you'd know.'"

## 7. Waveth

**Biology**: Sound/vibration
**Classification**: Neutral
**Appearance**: Visible as ripples in reality—compression waves in humanoid form. 1.5m tall. Pass through solid objects, but can solidify briefly through resonance. Speak in harmonics.
**Culture**: Communication-focused. Believe all conflict stems from misheard words. Translator-diplomats. Can amplify or dampen sound—useful and annoying in equal measure.
**Narrative Use**: Communication facilitation; sound puzzles; acoustic weapons; silence zones; hearing-impaired character interactions.
**Quick Hook**: "The Waveth passed through the wall, reforming beside me. 'Doors are... suggestions,' they hummed. 'You should have said you wanted privacy. I would have... not listened.'"

## 8. Radiax

**Biology**: Radiation spectrum
**Classification**: Hostile
**Appearance**: Sickly green-white glow in vaguely humanoid shape. 1.5-2m tall. Looking at them too long causes spots in vision. Presence measurable on Geiger counters. Deeply hazardous.
**Culture**: Contamination-spreaders. Not deliberately evil—they simply can't help emitting harmful radiation. Isolated by necessity. Desperately lonely, which makes them more dangerous.
**Narrative Use**: Environmental hazards; tragic antagonists; quarantine scenarios; timed encounters (exposure limits); horror elements.
**Quick Hook**: "The Radiax stayed at the far end of the room—a kindness. 'I would come closer,' they said, their voice crackling with interference. 'But I like you. And I don't want to kill you. Today.'"
