## Physical Description

The Luminara are beings of living light, their forms constantly shifting between geometric patterns and organic shapes. They exist as visible embodiments of cosmic harmonics—the underlying vibrations that some believe connect all matter and energy. Their colors shift through spectrums invisible to most species, and their movement creates faint musical tones.

No two Luminara look alike; each reflects the unique harmonic signature of their origin point. They communicate through resonance—vibrations felt more than heard, carrying meaning beneath words.

## Cultural Overview

Luminara perceive the universe as a vast symphony, with every being, object, and event contributing notes to an eternal composition. Their purpose—as they describe it—is to maintain harmonic balance, though what constitutes "balance" remains incomprehensible to material beings. They travel between worlds, listening, occasionally intervening to correct dissonances only they can hear.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Luminara find humanity's harmonic signature beautiful but fragile—a melody constantly at risk of discordance. They offer guidance when they can, appearing as benevolent presences who speak in metaphors of music and light. Their sympathy is genuine but their help is often abstract, offering spiritual comfort rather than practical assistance.
