## Physical Description

The Synthara are crystalline humanoids averaging 1.9 meters tall, with bodies composed of semi-transparent mineral matrices that pulse with internal energy. Their forms are angular and geometric, with faceted surfaces that refract light into prismatic displays. They have no distinct facial features—communication occurs through light patterns emanating from their core.

Their bodies can reconfigure limited portions of their crystalline structure, allowing them to form tools, interfaces, or healing arrays from their own substance. This reconfiguration is energy-intensive and requires recovery time.

## Cultural Overview

Synthara view the universe as an energy system to be optimized. Healing, to them, is correcting inefficiencies in biological systems. They approach medicine with mathematical precision—calculating optimal treatment protocols, resource allocation, and success probabilities. Their bedside manner is clinically cold but their results are exceptional.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Synthara find humans statistically interesting—a species with high variance in outcomes despite similar baseline parameters. They study human healing responses for academic purposes and will provide medical services for appropriate compensation. No sympathy, no hostility, just professional interest.
