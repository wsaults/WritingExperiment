## Physical Description

The Xelthari are silicon-based lifeforms averaging 2.5 meters tall, their bodies composed of interlocking crystalline segments in deep purple and black. They move with grinding deliberation, each step causing minor tremors. Their "faces" are clusters of sensor crystals that pulse with internal light when processing information or communicating.

Unlike organic warriors, Xelthari don't heal—they rebuild. Damaged segments are replaced with newly grown crystal, often incorporating improvements. Veteran Xelthari are patchworks of different crystal generations, some segments millennia old. Their bodies can reconfigure for different combat roles, shifting mass between offensive and defensive configurations.

## Cultural Overview

Xelthari think in terms of siege warfare and resource denial. Their patience rivals the Velthrani, but where Velthrani plot political victories, Xelthari plan infrastructure destruction. They view organic life as inefficient—useful for entertainment but ultimately obsolete.

---

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Xelthari consider humans a mineral extraction opportunity. Human bodies contain useful trace elements, and human worlds have untapped resources. They support the games primarily because contestant corpses are contractually available for processing. This clinical approach to human death makes them particularly chilling adversaries.
