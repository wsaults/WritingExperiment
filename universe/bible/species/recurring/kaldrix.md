## Physical Description

The Kaldrix are unique among diplomat species—each individual exists as multiple synchronized bodies. A typical Kaldrix maintains 3-7 instances, all sharing a single consciousness distributed across the bodies. Each instance is a small (1.2 meter) grey-skinned humanoid with oversized craniums and multiple sensory organs.

Their multiple bodies allow them to literally be in several places at once, monitoring all parties in a negotiation simultaneously. When a Kaldrix speaks, all their instances speak in perfect unison—an unsettling effect that emphasizes their unified nature.

## Cultural Overview

Kaldrix philosophy holds that true consensus requires experiencing all perspectives simultaneously. Their distributed consciousness lets them do this naturally—each instance can immerse in a different party's position while the unified mind synthesizes a solution acceptable to all. They find single-body species limiting.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Kaldrix are fascinated by human individuality and find human inability to share consciousness both limiting and liberating. They approach humans as a consensus-building challenge: how do you unite beings who can never truly share perspective? Some Kaldrix consider human cooperation despite isolation to be almost miraculous.
