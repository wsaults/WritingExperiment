## Physical Description

The Corvani are avian bipeds averaging 1.6 meters tall, with sleek black plumage that gleams with iridescent purple highlights. Their bodies are lean and angular, built for precision rather than power. Large, intelligent eyes—solid black with no visible pupil—dominate their narrow faces. Their beaks are sharp but primarily decorative; they speak through sophisticated vocal organs that can mimic any language perfectly.

Their most distinctive feature is their "truth feathers"—specialized plumage around the neck that subtly changes color based on their assessment of what they're hearing. Other Corvani read these shifts; other species rarely notice.

## Cultural Overview

Corvani society revolves around protocol, precedent, and precise language. They believe every conflict stems from miscommunication, and every miscommunication can be resolved through proper diplomatic procedure. Their archives contain every treaty, agreement, and negotiation in Consortium history—they never forget a precedent.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Corvani view humans as diplomatically immature—passionate, imprecise, and prone to emotional outbursts. However, they also see potential. Humans negotiate creatively, finding solutions the Corvani's rigid protocol would never consider. Some Corvani have begun studying "human-style" diplomacy as an alternative approach.
