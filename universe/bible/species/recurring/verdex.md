## Physical Description

The Verdex are tall, willowy beings averaging 2.1 meters, with green-brown skin that resembles living bark. Their bodies are partially photosynthetic, and fine root-like tendrils extend from their fingertips. Their faces have a serene, patient quality, and their movements are slow and deliberate—a Verdex rushing looks merely unhurried.

Their signature ability is bio-cultivation: Verdex can accelerate and direct plant growth through touch, growing structures, tools, and even weapons from living organic matter. A Verdex doesn't build a bridge—they grow one.

## Cultural Overview

Verdex philosophy holds that true creation nurtures rather than consumes. They grow their cities, their ships, their tools—all living, all capable of repair and evolution. They find "dead matter" construction barbaric, though they're diplomatic about expressing this view. Their patience is legendary; a Verdex project might take decades to mature.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Verdex feel a protective sympathy toward humans—short-lived creatures in a hostile universe. They offer aid when they can, growing healing plants and shelter for human survivors. However, their timescales don't match human urgency, and their help often arrives after the crisis has passed.
