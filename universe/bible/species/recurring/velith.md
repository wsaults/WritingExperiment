## Physical Description

The Velith are plant-animal hybrids averaging 1.7 meters tall, with bodies that blend humanoid structure with botanical elements. Their skin is a living bark that shifts from pale green to deep brown with seasons and mood. Vine-like tendrils extend from their heads in place of hair, tipped with bioluminescent nodules that glow when they channel healing energies.

Their faces are delicate, with large amber eyes and small mouths. Photosynthetic patches across their shoulders and backs supplement their diet. Their hands end in six fingers, each capable of extruding healing sap with different medicinal properties.

## Cultural Overview

Velith culture revolves around growth—personal, communal, and literal. They view healing as the universe's way of affirming life over entropy. Death in their philosophy isn't failure but transformation into new growth. They maintain vast garden-ships that serve as mobile hospitals throughout Consortium space.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Velith consider humans tragically beautiful—short-lived beings burning brightly before inevitable decay. They offer healing assistance to human contestants when possible, though Consortium regulations limit their intervention. Some Velith operate underground medical stations that human survivors desperately seek.
