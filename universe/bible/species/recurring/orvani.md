## Physical Description

The Orvani are symbiotic organisms—a host body and a healing parasite that merge into a single entity. The host bodies vary widely (the Orvani parasite can bond with many species), but the parasite component is consistent: a web of silver-blue filaments that integrate with the host's nervous system and emerge at connection points across the skin.

When an Orvani heals another being, they extend these filaments into the patient, temporarily merging biological systems. The process is deeply intimate and disturbing to watch—patients describe feeling "borrowed" during treatment.

## Cultural Overview

Orvani believe consciousness is meant to be shared. Their healing philosophy involves temporarily joining with patients to understand and correct biological damage from the inside. This makes them incredibly effective healers but raises serious consent questions. Some patients find the experience transformative; others find it violating.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Orvani are fascinated by human individuality—how fiercely humans resist mental connection even when it could save their lives. Some Orvani see this as a challenge to overcome; others respect it as an interesting survival adaptation. Their offers of healing come with implicit strings attached.
