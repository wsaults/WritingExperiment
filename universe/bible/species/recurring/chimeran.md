## Physical Description

The Chimeran are partial shapeshifters averaging 1.7 meters in base form, with grey-brown rubbery skin and indistinct features. Unlike the Morphex who achieve complete transformation, Chimeran can only modify portions of their bodies—a face here, a limb there. The result is often disturbing: a familiar face on an unfamiliar body, or vice versa.

Their transformations are imperfect and temporary, lasting hours at most before degrading. But hours is enough to steal an identity, commit a crime, and vanish. Their natural form is deliberately forgettable—they evolved to be overlooked.

## Cultural Overview

Chimeran society values infiltration and exploitation. They see other species as marks to be mimicked and manipulated. Their internal hierarchy is based on the value of identities stolen—a Chimeran who successfully impersonated a Velthrani noble has higher status than one who only mimics commoners.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Chimeran view humans as easy targets with valuable identities. Human faces are relatively simple to copy, and human social structures are trusting enough to exploit. Several documented cases exist of Chimeran impersonating human contestants to steal rewards or sabotage runs.
