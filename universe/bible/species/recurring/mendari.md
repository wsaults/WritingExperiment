## Physical Description

The Mendari are small, multi-limbed beings resembling upright arthropods with soft, segmented bodies. They stand roughly 1.3 meters tall and possess six specialized limbs—two for locomotion, four for manipulation. Their compound eyes can perceive cellular-level detail without magnification, and their mandibles are capable of incredibly precise surgical movements.

Most remarkable is their "healing saliva"—a complex biochemical compound that accelerates tissue regeneration in most carbon-based life forms.

## Cultural Overview

Mendari society is built around medical mastery. Status derives entirely from healing achievements—diseases cured, procedures pioneered, lives saved. They view the games with clinical detachment: every injury is data, every death a failure to study.

---

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Mendari approach humans as fascinating research subjects. Human physiology contains novelties worth studying. Their care is excellent but impersonal—they're healing an interesting specimen, not a person.
