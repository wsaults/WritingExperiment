## Physical Description

The Nullborn appear as humanoid-shaped voids—darkness in the form of beings. Light doesn't illuminate them; it simply stops at their edges. Where they stand, shadows deepen impossibly. Their "faces" show no features, yet beings near them feel watched, studied, judged.

When they move, reality seems to bend slightly around them, as if space itself is uncomfortable with their presence. They can pass through solid matter by simply not being where matter is—a concept that makes geometric sense only to them.

## Cultural Overview

No one knows where the Nullborn come from or what they want. They appear without warning, observe, occasionally intervene in events for reasons known only to themselves, then vanish. Some scholars believe they're maintaining some cosmic balance; others think they're simply curious. The Nullborn themselves speak in riddles, contradictions, and uncomfortable truths.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Nullborn show inexplicable interest in humans—appearing at crucial moments, offering assistance or obstruction with equal likelihood. Some humans have been saved by Nullborn intervention; others have been driven mad by encounters. Whether they're testing humanity or protecting it remains unknowable.
