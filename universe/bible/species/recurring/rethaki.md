## Physical Description

The Rethaki are small, stocky beings averaging 1.3 meters, with tough gray-brown skin evolved for their former homeworld's harsh radiation. Four small eyes arranged in a diamond pattern give them exceptional peripheral vision. Their bodies are compact and resilient, built for survival.

The most notable feature is the memorial scarification every adult Rethaki bears: intricate patterns carved into their skin recording their lineage's losses. Some elders bear so many names they've run out of visible skin, continuing onto bone implants. A Rethaki's body is literally a monument to everyone they've lost.

## Cultural Overview

The Rethaki were harvested 80,000 cycles ago. Their homeworld became a particularly deadly Game Zone—the Consortium marketed it as "extreme difficulty" entertainment. Over forty millennia, the Rethaki population dropped from 12 billion to under 100,000. The Consortium eventually declared them extinct, closed their Game Zone, and moved on.

But the Rethaki survived. Hidden enclaves, underground communities, diaspora groups in sympathetic territories—they persisted through pure stubbornness. Today they exist in legal limbo: officially dead, actually alive, belonging nowhere.

Their culture centers on memory. Every Rethaki child learns the names of their ancestors who fell in the games. Every gathering begins with recitation. They refuse to be forgotten, even if the galaxy would prefer they disappeared entirely.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Sympathetic/Protective

The Rethaki see their own past in humanity's present. They know exactly how bad things can get—and how much worse they can become. Some work directly with human resistance movements. Others simply bear witness, ensuring that whatever happens to humanity, someone will remember.

They're living proof that survival is possible. Also living proof of what survival costs.
