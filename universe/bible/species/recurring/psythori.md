## Physical Description

The Psythori are nightmare-inducing beings averaging 1.9 meters tall, with cephalopod-like head structures dominated by four to six facial tentacles surrounding a lamprey-like mouth. Their skin ranges from pale mauve to deep purple, glistening with protective mucus that allows them to survive briefly in vacuum.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Humanoid frame, slightly hunched posture
- Head: Bulbous cranium housing enlarged brain tissue; four to six facial tentacles (2-3 feet long)
- Eyes: Four milky white orbs with no visible pupils; see through psychic perception more than light
- Skin: Rubbery, purple-mauve, mucus-coated
- Hands: Three-fingered with suction pads; surprisingly dexterous
- Movement: Gliding gait; often levitate short distances using telekinesis
- Presence: Causes instinctive revulsion in most sapient species (evolved warning response)

Their most distinctive feature is the psychic pressure they emit—a constant low-level telepathic broadcast that other species experience as headaches, paranoia, or the sensation of being watched. Powerful Psythori can suppress this; lesser ones cannot.

## Cultural Overview

Psythori society is rigidly hierarchical, stratified by psychic power. The most powerful telepaths rule absolutely, their will enforced through direct mental domination. Lesser Psythori exist in descending tiers of autonomy—some retain individual thought, others function as extensions of their superiors.

**Core Values**:
- *Psy'dom* (Mental Supremacy): Psychic power is the only legitimate authority
- *Thrall'tek* (Useful Servitude): Non-psychic species exist to serve or feed
- *Col'unity* (Collective Superiority): Individual Psythori matter less than the species' advancement

The Psythori consume neural tissue—specifically, they extract and absorb the memories, skills, and psychic essence of other sapients. This isn't purely nutritional; they gain knowledge and capabilities from their victims. A Psythori who consumes a skilled engineer gains engineering knowledge.

This practice makes them terrifyingly adaptable but also dependent on "feeding populations." Their relationship with the games is partly motivated by access to diverse neural patterns.

---

## Political Structure

Psythori governance operates through the *Overmind Congress*—a psychic collective of the twelve most powerful Psythori minds, linked in permanent telepathic communion. They rule by consensus, though "consensus" among telepaths often means the strongest mind prevails.

Below the Overmind:
- **Mindlords**: Regional rulers with domain over thrall populations
- **Thinkbinders**: Administrators and enforcers of psychic hierarchy
- **Commons**: Psythori with limited psychic range; serve as soldiers, workers, infiltrators
- **Nulls**: Rare Psythori born without psychic ability; killed at birth or enslaved

The Overmind maintains Consortium membership primarily for access to diverse species as feeding stock and to prevent unified action against their kind.

## Relationship to Games/System

The Psythori are game enthusiasts—not as contestants but as sponsors and manipulators. They find the games produce contestants with highly developed mental patterns worth consuming.

**Game Involvement**:
- Sponsor contestants specifically to acquire them post-success (contractual "retirement" clauses)
- Operate as dungeon designers for certain high-difficulty mental challenge zones
- Maintain thrall populations on multiple game worlds
- Trade in "prime specimens"—contestants with unusual mental capabilities

The System restricts Psythori from direct psychic interference in active games—one of the few rules they technically respect, as violation would unite other species against them.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Hostile (Acquisitive)

The Psythori find humans *fascinating*—not with sympathy, but appetite. Human neural architecture is unusual: dense pattern recognition, creative problem-solving, and emotional complexity in a relatively small package. Human memories taste "rich" by Psythori standards.

Human adaptability also makes harvested human skills particularly transferable. A Psythori who consumes multiple human engineers can synthesize approaches no single human possessed.

This makes humans high-value targets. Psythori sponsors specifically seek out promising human contestants, offering generous support in exchange for "retirement contracts" that deliver the contestant to Psythori custody upon game completion or death.

Marcus and other aware humans should treat Psythori offers with extreme suspicion.

## Notable Individuals

**Overmind Primary Keth'sul**: Eldest of the Overmind Congress, approximately 8,000 cycles old. Has consumed over ten million sapient minds and retains fragmentary access to all their memories. Personality has become increasingly alien as original Psythori identity dilutes among absorbed consciousnesses.

**Mindlord Vex'thaal**: Oversees Psythori involvement in human-accessible game zones. Known for "generous" sponsorship offers and creative contract language. Has consumed over 200 human contestants.

**Thinkbinder Null'ix**: A unique anomaly—a Psythori born without psychic power who survived through cunning and political manipulation. Operates as the Psythori's primary non-psychic interface with species resistant to mental contact. Deeply hated by other Psythori but too useful to eliminate.

---

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: Consortium (Full Member with restrictions)
- **Allied**: Old Guard (tactical alliance against contestant-rights movements)
- **Opposed**: Liberation Collective (ethical opposition); Kindari (specific ancestral grievance)
- **Complicated**: The Observers (mutual interest in unusual specimens; mutual distrust)

The Psythori maintain Consortium membership because exclusion would make them targets. Other species tolerate their presence because Psythori provide valuable services (mind-reading during negotiations, truth verification) and because war with telepaths is expensive.

## Combat Capabilities

Psythori rarely engage in physical combat—why fight when you can dominate?

**Psychic Abilities**:
- *Mind Blast*: Area-effect psychic assault causing pain, disorientation, unconsciousness
- *Domination*: Direct mental control over weaker minds; duration varies by target resistance
- *Thought Reading*: Surface thoughts accessible; deep memories require sustained contact
- *Psychic Shield*: Defense against other psychics and System interference

**Physical Combat** (when forced):
- Tentacle grapple leading to neural extraction (lethal)
- Levitation provides mobility advantage
- Weak physical durability; rely on thralls as meat shields

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Strong willpower reduces psychic effectiveness
- Certain species have natural resistance (Thex Collective's hive-mind, Axiom's distributed consciousness)
- Physical ambush before psychic awareness engages
- System provides some protection to active contestants

---

## Narrative Function

The Psythori serve as horror elements within the action-comedy framework—moments of genuine dread amid the dark humor. They represent the galaxy's capacity for evil that isn't merely different values but genuine predation.

They provide:
- High-stakes sponsor encounters (tempting deals with terrible fine print)
- Mind-control plot complications
- Information extraction opportunities (consume an enemy, gain their knowledge)
- Body horror when appropriate
- Villains who cannot be reasoned with on human terms
