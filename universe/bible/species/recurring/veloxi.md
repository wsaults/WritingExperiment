## Physical Description

The Veloxi are insectoid beings averaging 1.4 meters tall, with segmented bodies covered in chitinous plates of deep burgundy. Their most striking feature is their compound eyes—each containing thousands of individual lenses that process visual information at speeds other species can't match. They see in spectrums beyond visible light, detecting heat signatures, electrical fields, and subtle movements.

Multiple antennae extend from their heads, constantly sampling chemical, electromagnetic, and quantum information from their environment. A Veloxi in a room knows everyone's stress levels, recent meals, and communication device activity within minutes.

## Cultural Overview

Veloxi society operates as an information market. Every piece of data has value; every interaction is a potential transaction. They don't distinguish between gossip and state secrets—all information is currency. Their hives function as living databases, with information flowing constantly between individuals through chemical and electromagnetic exchange.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Veloxi view humans as prolific information generators. Human drama, conflict, and emotional complexity produce massive data streams that Veloxi eagerly collect and trade. Their attitude toward individual humans depends entirely on the information value that human represents—a boring human is worthless; an interesting one is precious.
