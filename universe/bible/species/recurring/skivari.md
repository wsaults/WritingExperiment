## Physical Description

The Skivari are small, quick bipeds averaging 1.1 meters tall, with lean bodies built for speed and evasion. Their skin shifts colors constantly—a natural camouflage they've evolved into an art form of deception. Large eyes with slit pupils dominate their faces, flanked by oversized ears that swivel independently.

Their most distinctive feature is their "shimmer glands"—organs that project minor illusions within a three-meter radius. These illusions are imperfect (they flicker at edges) but effective enough for misdirection. Every Skivari learns to weaponize these projections from childhood.

## Cultural Overview

Skivari culture treats deception as the highest art form. They don't lie to hurt—they lie because truth is boring. Their social hierarchy is based on the complexity and elegance of one's deceptions. Getting caught in a lie isn't shameful; getting caught in a *simple* lie is devastating.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Skivari adore humans—specifically, they adore tricking humans. Human contestants are considered delightful marks: trusting enough to be fooled, clever enough to make the challenge interesting. Some Skivari take human-trickery tourism seriously, traveling to watch games specifically to see humans deceived.
