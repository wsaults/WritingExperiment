## Physical Description

The Driftari are slender humanoids averaging 1.8 meters, with iridescent skin that shifts color with emotional state—originally evolved for communication in their species' dense forest homeworld, now a liability they've learned to partially suppress. Large, dark-adapted eyes and vestigial ear-fins mark their aquatic evolutionary ancestors.

Most distinctive is their flexibility: Driftari have additional joints in their limbs, allowing them to fold into remarkably small spaces. This evolved for arboreal living but proves useful for survival in cramped ship quarters. They can fit where others cannot.

## Cultural Overview

The Driftari homeworld was destroyed—not by the games, but by natural catastrophe—fifty thousand cycles ago. The Consortium offered them refugee status in exchange for game participation. They refused. Every generation since has refused.

Now they exist as a permanent nomad fleet, moving from system to system, never staying long enough to be claimed or conscripted. They trade, work, and move on before authorities can process their presence. They're galactic ghosts, present everywhere and belonging nowhere.

Their culture emphasizes impermanence and adaptation. Driftari children learn that attachment to places brings only grief. Home is the fleet; home is each other; home is wherever you happen to be sleeping tonight.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Neutral/Pragmatic

The Driftari observe humans with professional interest. They survived by refusing the games; humans are surviving within them. Different paths, same fundamental problem. Some Driftari trade with human settlements, exchanging goods and information. They're careful not to get attached—they've learned better.

They represent the road not taken: what humanity might have been if they'd said no.
