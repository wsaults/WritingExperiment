## Designations

- **Self-Designation**: *Ex'ili* ("Those Who Chose to Leave")

## Physical Description

The Exili are tall, willowy beings averaging 2.2 meters in height, with elongated limbs and delicate features. Their skin ranges from pale silver to deep indigo, and they possess four eyes arranged in a diamond pattern—two for visible light, two for electromagnetic fields. Their appearance suggests fragility, but they've survived 200,000 cycles of isolation through careful engineering.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Tall, slender, elegant proportions
- Skin: Silver to indigo; subtle bioluminescent patterns
- Eyes: Four in diamond arrangement; outer pair see EM fields
- Limbs: Long, graceful; evolved for low-gravity environments
- Movement: Flowing, measured; nothing wasted
- Presence: Serene; disquieting calm

Exili who leave isolation stand out in Consortium space—their calm is disturbing to species accustomed to constant competition.

## Cultural Overview

The Exili were once Consortium members, even serving on several councils. Then, approximately 200,000 cycles ago, they witnessed a species' extinction during the games and experienced a collective moral crisis. Their governing philosophy concluded that participation in any system that harvested sapient beings for entertainment was ethically impossible.

So they left. Not through war or confrontation—through withdrawal. They sealed their territory, ended all Consortium trade, and removed themselves from galactic society.

**Core Values**:
- *Ex'thani* (Principled Distance): Some evils cannot be reformed; they can only be abandoned
- *Ili'serev* (Self-Sufficiency): Dependence on the corrupt makes you complicit
- *Veth'exali* (Witness Without Participation): Know what happens; refuse to enable it

The Exili maintain observation networks throughout Consortium space. They watch, record, judge—and do nothing. This is their compromise: they will not participate, but they will not pretend ignorance either.

---

## Political Structure

Exili society operates through consensus councils with rotating membership. Decisions require near-unanimity, which means decisions happen slowly. This is intentional—they learned from Consortium politics that speed enables atrocity.

Their isolation is maintained by the *Withdrawal Compact*—a foundational agreement that defines what contact with Consortium space is permitted (observation, humanitarian aid) and forbidden (trade, alliance, political engagement).

---

## Relationship to Games/System

The Exili consider the games an ongoing atrocity that they refuse to participate in or enable. They don't watch broadcasts. They don't trade with game-involved species. They've built their entire society around not being complicit.

**Their Compromise**:
- Monitor game zones for humanitarian opportunities
- Occasionally extract survivors (technically violates Withdrawal Compact; ethically necessary)
- Provide no resources that could support game infrastructure
- Accept no benefits from Consortium membership

Some Exili argue they should do more—actively sabotage games, rescue contestants, fight the Consortium. These radicals are marginalized; the majority believes that intervention would make them participants rather than objectors.

---

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Neutral/Sympathetic (complicated)

The Exili feel deep sympathy for humans but refuse to act on it in ways that would compromise their withdrawal. They've offered humans sanctuary in Exili space—those who can reach it are welcome. But they won't help humans reach it.

This frustrates many humans who learn of the Exili. "You have the technology to help and you won't" is a common accusation. The Exili respond that helping would require participating in Consortium systems, which would make them complicit in the broader atrocity. Their sympathy is genuine; their principles are absolute.

A small Exili faction called the *Compassionate* disagrees. They operate covertly, extracting human survivors when possible, providing information to resistance movements. The mainstream Exili consider them well-meaning traitors to everything Exili society represents.

## Notable Individuals

**Consensus Prime Veth'elix**: Current chair of the primary Exili council. Has maintained the Withdrawal Compact for 40,000 cycles. Believes the Exili example—proving that societies can exist without Consortium corruption—is more valuable than any individual rescue.

**Ex'serath the Compassionate**: Leader of the radical faction. Argues that principled distance has become principled cowardice. Operates extraction networks that have saved approximately 50,000 contestants over the past 10,000 cycles. Exiled from mainstream Exili society but not pursued.

**Observer Keth'ili**: Head of the Exili observation network. Maintains comprehensive records of Consortium activities, including games. These records theoretically could help reform movements but are never shared—Exili observe, they don't participate. The hypocrisy is noted but not addressed.

---

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: None (withdrawal means no faction participation)
- **Unofficial Sympathy**: Liberation Collective (share ethical concerns; refuse to ally)
- **Opposed**: Consortium broadly (the evil they fled)
- **Complicated**: All factions (some want Exili resources/technology; Exili refuse all)

The Exili possess advanced technology developed during 200,000 cycles of isolation. Their defensive capabilities could significantly impact Consortium politics if deployed. They refuse to deploy them—violence would make them participants.

This frustrates reformists and revolutionaries who see the Exili as potential allies. The Exili see themselves as proof that another way is possible—not as tools for others' revolutions.

---

## Narrative Function

The Exili represent the moral question of principled non-participation. They provide:

- Ethical complexity (is refusing to help actually moral?)
- Sanctuary possibility (escape exists, but reaching it...)
- Commentary on privilege (easy to have principles when you're safe)
- Historical perspective (they've watched 200,000 cycles of atrocity)
- Hope and frustration in equal measure

Marcus and other protagonists may encounter Exili who help despite their society's rules, or who refuse to help because of them. Both interactions generate meaningful conflict.
