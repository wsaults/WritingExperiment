## Physical Description

The Vexith are ethereal humanoids averaging 1.8 meters tall, with bodies that seem slightly out of phase with normal reality. Their forms shimmer and blur at the edges, making them difficult to focus on directly. Their skin is translucent, revealing complex internal structures that pulse with probability calculations.

Their eyes are the most unsettling feature—they don't look *at* things but *through* them, seeing potential futures layered over the present. When a Vexith focuses on you, they're calculating every possible outcome of your next actions.

## Cultural Overview

Vexith society is built on probability manipulation. They don't exactly change luck—they identify and nudge toward favorable probability branches. Their philosophy holds that free will is an illusion; everything is statistics. This makes them excellent at games of chance and terrible at genuine emotional connection.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Vexith find humans statistically anomalous. Human contestants consistently achieve outcomes their probability models can't explain—they call this the "human variance factor." Some Vexith study humans obsessively; others avoid them because they disrupt careful calculations.
