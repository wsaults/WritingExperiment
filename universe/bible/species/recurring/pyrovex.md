## Designations

- **Formal**: Pyrovex Plasma Collective
- **Common**: Pyrovex, "The Burning Ones"
- **Slang**: Fire Spirits, Plasma Ghosts, Walking Supernovas
- **Self-Designation**: *Pyr'vexal* ("Those Who Are Flame")

## Physical Description

The Pyrovex are living plasma entities—coherent patterns of superheated matter that maintain consciousness through electromagnetic fields. In their natural state, they appear as humanoid shapes of contained fire, ranging from soft orange to intense blue-white depending on emotional state and energy reserves.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Humanoid shape, approximately 2 meters tall when manifesting
- Composition: Plasma contained by self-generated magnetic fields
- Color: Temperature indicates mood (cool orange = calm; bright white = agitated/powerful)
- Eyes: Two dense plasma concentrations that serve as sensory nodes
- Movement: Gliding, floating; can compress to travel through small spaces or expand to intimidate
- Presence: Radiates heat; temperature rises noticeably within 10 meters
- Containment: Must manifest within specialized suits/vessels when in conventional environments

Without containment technology, Pyrovex presence is destructive to most environments. They can modulate their output but cannot fully suppress it—even a calm Pyrovex radiates enough heat to make nearby organic beings uncomfortable.

## Cultural Overview

Pyrovex culture centers on transformation and energy exchange. They don't understand static existence—everything should burn, change, become something new. This philosophy extends to social relationships, political positions, and personal identity.

**Core Values**:
- *Pyr'thani* (Transformation Imperative): Stagnation is death; change is life
- *Vex'kalor* (Energy Supremacy): Power should flow to those who can channel it
- *Kor'pyrel* (Passionate Existence): Live intensely; half-measures are contemptible

Pyrovex relationships are intense and brief by most species' standards. They form deep connections quickly, burn through them, and move on. Long-term partnerships exist but are considered unusual—two flames that somehow enhance rather than consume each other.

---

## Political Structure

Pyrovex governance is meritocratic chaos. Leadership goes to whoever burns brightest—literally. Political disputes are settled through energy displays where contestants attempt to overwhelm each other with raw power output.

The current governing body, the *Crucible Council*, consists of the twelve most powerful Pyrovex. Membership changes frequently as individuals wax and wane in power. Council decisions require majority but achieving majority means convincing beings who respect nothing but demonstrated capability.

## Relationship to Games/System

The Pyrovex embrace the games enthusiastically. Competition, transformation, survival of the capable—these align perfectly with their values. They view the games as the System's acknowledgment that stagnant civilizations deserve culling.

**Game Involvement**:
- Popular as contestants (energy manipulation abilities translate well)
- Sponsor aggressively (favor contestants who demonstrate adaptability)
- Design fire/energy-themed dungeon challenges
- Controversial reputation for "exciting" arena designs with high casualty rates

The System provides containment technology that allows Pyrovex to participate without accidentally incinerating everything. This technology has made Pyrovex one of the more visually spectacular contestant species.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Wildcard/Interested

Pyrovex find humans fascinating—specifically, they're intrigued by human adaptability despite physical fragility. Humans shouldn't survive their circumstances, yet they persist, transform, overcome. This earns grudging respect.

However, Pyrovex respect is dangerous. They expect those they respect to meet high standards. A human who impresses a Pyrovex may find themselves pushed into increasingly extreme challenges "for their own growth." Pyrovex encouragement can be lethal.

They also find human emotional intensity interesting. Humans burn hot for short-lived creatures—passion, rage, love, all expressed with surprising fire. Pyrovex appreciate this even if they consider human lifespans tragically brief.

## Notable Individuals

**Crucible Prime Keth'vorax**: Current leader of the Crucible Council, burning at temperatures exceeding most stellar cores. Advocates for expanding game participation quotas—more species should have the "opportunity" to prove themselves. Has sponsored several human contestants, with mixed survival rates.

**Pyr'seleth the Contained**: A Pyrovex philosopher who chose permanent containment in a crystalline vessel to experience "cold existence." Considered either enlightened or insane by other Pyrovex. Provides surprisingly balanced perspectives on species relations.

**The Ember Collective**: A group of Pyrovex who've learned to moderate their output enough to maintain long-term presence in conventional environments. Serve as primary Pyrovex diplomats and merchants. Other Pyrovex consider them somewhat diminished; other species find them the only Pyrovex they can safely interact with.

---

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: None consistently (too individualistic for permanent alliance)
- **Frequent Alliance**: Commercial interests (energy trade is lucrative)
- **Occasional Support**: Old Guard (share philosophy of competition)
- **Opposed**: Liberation Collective (consider contestant protections weakness)
- **Complicated**: Thex Collective (major energy trade partner; philosophical differences)

The Pyrovex vote unpredictably in Consortium matters, usually supporting whatever position seems most likely to generate change, conflict, or interesting outcomes. They find stability boring.

## Combat Capabilities

Pyrovex are devastating in combat but require containment failure to reach full potential.

**Energy Abilities**:
- *Plasma Projection*: Ranged attacks of superheated matter
- *Heat Aura*: Passive damage to anything nearby
- *Thermal Absorption*: Can consume fire/heat attacks to power themselves
- *Containment Breach*: Expanding to full plasma state; catastrophically destructive but depletes reserves

**In Containment Suits**:
- Focused energy beams
- Temperature manipulation (heating objects to failure points)
- Limited flight via thermal manipulation
- Reduced but sustainable combat capability

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Extreme cold can weaken them (not kill, but diminish)
- Water/liquid dousing can temporarily disrupt coherence
- Vacuum doesn't sustain plasma well (ironic for stellar beings)
- Depleted energy reserves force dormancy

---

## Narrative Function

The Pyrovex serve as dramatic, visually striking allies or opponents. Their philosophy of transformation through challenge creates interesting mentor-antagonist dynamics.

They provide:
- Spectacular combat encounters
- Challenging sponsors who push contestants beyond comfort zones
- Environmental hazards (their presence changes terrain)
- Commentary on competitive philosophies taken to extremes
- Visual spectacle appropriate to the action elements of the genre
