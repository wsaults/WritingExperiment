## Physical Description

The Skalven are heavily-built mammalian humanoids averaging 1.8 meters tall, covered in coarse grey-brown fur with distinctive white markings around their eyes. Their faces combine canine and ursine features—broad muzzles, sharp teeth, and small rounded ears. Thick muscle and dense bone structure makes them natural heavy infantry.

Their most distinctive feature is their "war paint"—bioluminescent bacteria they cultivate in their fur, creating glowing patterns that identify clan, rank, and contract status. A Skalven's patterns tell their entire professional history to those who can read them.

## Cultural Overview

Skalven culture revolves around honor-bound mercenary work. They sell their combat services across the galaxy but adhere to strict professional codes. Contracts are sacred—a Skalven who breaks contract faces exile or death. This reliability makes them valued despite their neutrality on most political issues.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Skalven view humans as potential clients and competitors. They neither hate nor love humanity—they simply assess whether humans can pay and whether fighting humans would be profitable. Several Skalven mercenary companies have taken human contracts, though this remains controversial within their holds.
