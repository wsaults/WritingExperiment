## Physical Description

The Velathi are tall, willowy humanoids averaging 2.1 meters, with translucent blue-tinged skin that reveals bioluminescent circulatory systems beneath. Their elongated fingers end in specialized glands that secrete various healing compounds. Their faces are serene, with large silver eyes that can detect biochemical distress at a glance.

Most striking is their "empathy corona"—a faint luminous aura that shifts color based on the health state of nearby beings. This involuntary response makes them incapable of ignoring suffering.

## Cultural Overview

Velathi society centers on the sacred obligation to preserve life. They do not distinguish between species, factions, or moral standing when treating the wounded. This neutrality has made them invaluable—and vulnerable.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Velathi find humans endlessly fascinating and deeply concerning. Human contestants generate novel injuries at remarkable rates. They will treat any human who reaches them, regardless of faction politics.
