## Physical Description

The Tesseri are slender, multi-armed beings averaging 1.8 meters tall, with four delicate arms ending in fingers of extraordinary precision. Their skin shifts through metallic hues—copper, silver, gold—depending on what materials they've recently worked. Large, faceted eyes perceive matter at the molecular level, seeing the hidden patterns in all substances.

Their signature ability is pattern-weaving: Tesseri can manipulate the molecular structure of materials through touch, reshaping metal, stone, and crystal without tools. A Tesseri artisan doesn't forge a blade—they convince the metal to become one.

## Cultural Overview

Tesseri culture revolves around creation as spiritual practice. Every object they make carries a piece of their essence. They don't mass-produce; each item is unique, crafted for a specific purpose and recipient. Their workshops are temples where artisans enter meditative states to commune with their materials.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Tesseri find human tool-use fascinating—creatures who cannot touch-shape yet create remarkable things through indirect manipulation. They respect human creativity and often take human commissions, viewing each request as a puzzle worth solving. Some Tesseri have formed mentorship bonds with human survivors.
