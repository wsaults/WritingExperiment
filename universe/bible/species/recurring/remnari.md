## Physical Description

The Remnari are slender, gray-skinned humanoids averaging 1.5 meters tall. Their most distinctive feature is their large, dark eyes adapted for low-light environments—a legacy of generations hiding in the dark places between civilizations. Their frames are lean from scarcity, their movements quiet from survival necessity.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Slender humanoid, slightly shorter than human average
- Skin: Gray to pale blue; thin, showing blood vessels in harsh light
- Eyes: Large, dark, highly light-sensitive; adapted for darkness
- Limbs: Long fingers evolved for fine manipulation
- Movement: Quiet, economical; habitual stealth
- Presence: Often overlooked; have learned to be unnoticeable

Remnari children are taught from birth to be invisible. Their survival depends on not being found.

## Cultural Overview

Remnari culture is defined by loss. They were once a thriving civilization of artisans and engineers until the Consortium selected them for the games approximately 50,000 cycles ago. Their homeworld was converted to a Game Zone. Their population was harvested for entertainment.

What makes the Remnari unique: they lost. Completely. Their species was officially declared extinct when their last documented contestant died in the games. The Consortium closed their file and moved on.

Except survivors remained—those who hid, who fled, who were written off as statistical errors. These survivors formed the Remnari Collective, living in the spaces between civilizations, never staying anywhere long enough to be noticed.

**Core Values**:
- *Rem'veth* (Survival Imperative): Exist. Persist. That is enough.
- *Keth'rem* (Hidden Memory): Remember who we were, but tell no one
- *Val'nari* (Collective Burden): No Remnari survives alone

Their culture has become entirely focused on survival and memory. They preserve records of their lost civilization, pass down stories of their homeworld, and wait—for what, even they're not sure.

## Political Structure

The Remnari have no formal government. Leadership is practical: whoever can keep their group alive leads until they can't. Decisions are made by consensus because dissent is a luxury refugees cannot afford.

The closest thing to species-wide organization is the *Memory Council*—scattered elders who maintain contact through encrypted channels and preserve the complete history of Remnari civilization. Their role is archival, not political.

---

## Relationship to Games/System

The Remnari relationship with the games is defined by trauma. They are the proof that the games can destroy entire civilizations. They watched their species die for entertainment.

**Current Involvement**:
- None official (they don't exist)
- Covert information networks (they know game systems intimately from inside)
- Occasional assistance to contestants (particularly other "small" species)
- Deep institutional knowledge of Consortium weaknesses

Some Remnari want revenge. Others just want to be left alone. A few advocate for warning new contestant species about what awaits them. The debate continues across hidden settlements.

---

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Sympathetic/Protective

The Remnari see themselves in humans—a young species, recently harvested, not yet understanding what they face. Some Remnari have approached human survivors with warnings and assistance.

This assistance is complicated. Remnari help is practical but comes with difficult truths. They can tell humans how to survive the games. They cannot tell humans how to win—because the Remnari didn't win. Their example is survival through hiding, not through victory.

Some humans find Remnari perspective valuable. Others find it depressing. The Remnari understand; they remember when their own species still had hope.

## Notable Individuals

**Elder Keth'varis**: Oldest known Remnari, approximately 12,000 cycles old (Remnari are long-lived when not being killed). Maintains the primary Memory Archive and makes decisions about when and whether to assist other species. Deeply cautious; has seen too many "promising" species destroyed.

**Rem'selex "The Visible"**: A Remnari who rejected hiding, openly declaring Remnari existence to the Consortium. Was ignored—the Consortium prefers their records accurate, and Remnari are extinct in those records. Now operates as a independent information broker, trading Remnari knowledge of game systems for resources.

**The Shadow Network**: A loose organization of Remnari who specialize in helping contestant species survive. Not win—survive. Their methods focus on hiding, escaping, going unnoticed. Critics say they teach cowardice; they say they teach the only strategy that actually works long-term.

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: None (officially don't exist)
- **Unofficial Alliance**: Liberation Collective (share goals; Kindari know Remnari exist)
- **Opposed**: Consortium broadly (destroyed their species)
- **Complicated**: Other refugee populations (compete for hiding spaces)

The Remnari's greatest asset is that the Consortium believes them extinct. Revealing themselves would trigger extermination protocols. So they watch, remember, and occasionally help—always from the shadows.

---

## Narrative Function

The Remnari serve as living warnings—proof that the games have consequences, that species can be destroyed, that "entertainment" has costs. They provide:

- Historical perspective (what happens when a species loses)
- Practical survival knowledge (hiding, escaping, enduring)
- Emotional weight (meeting extinction survivors)
- Hope and despair in equal measure (they survived, but at what cost?)
- Moral complexity (is hiding survival or surrender?)
