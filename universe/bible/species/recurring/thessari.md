## Physical Description

The Thessari are willowy humanoids averaging 1.9 meters tall, with pale blue-grey skin and large, expressive eyes that shift color with emotional states. Their bodies are deliberately non-threatening—no claws, no fangs, no obvious weapons. Delicate antennae extend from their temples, constantly reading emotional resonance from nearby beings.

Their touch transmits emotional impressions—not telepathy, but a direct sharing of feeling. A Thessari handshake tells both parties exactly how the other feels about the negotiation. This makes them impossible to deceive and uncomfortable to lie around.

## Cultural Overview

Thessari culture centers on emotional truth. They believe all conflicts ultimately stem from unacknowledged feelings, and resolution requires bringing those feelings into the open. Their mediation style is gentle but relentless—they won't let parties leave until underlying emotions are addressed.

---

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Thessari find humans emotionally overwhelming but deeply sympathetic. Human feelings are intense, chaotic, and often contradictory—exactly the kind of emotional knots the Thessari are driven to untangle. Many Thessari advocate strongly for human welfare, not from logic but from genuine emotional connection.
