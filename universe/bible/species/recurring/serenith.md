## Physical Description

The Serenith appear as tall, translucent humanoids who seem to flicker in and out of focus. Their forms shimmer with temporal distortion—sometimes showing multiple versions of themselves overlaid, echoes of past and future positions. Their eyes are silver mirrors reflecting not what is, but what was and might be.

Their signature nature is temporal perception: Serenith experience time non-linearly, perceiving past, present, and branching futures simultaneously. They exist partially outside normal timeflow, making them immune to temporal attacks but also making communication with them fragmentary and surreal.

## Cultural Overview

Serenith culture—if it can be called that—operates on timescales and logics incomprehensible to linear beings. They gather at convergence points where timelines intersect, exchanging information across temporal boundaries. What they seek or value remains unknowable; their actions appear random unless viewed across centuries.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Serenith treat humans as fascinating temporal anomalies—a species whose choices create unusual branching patterns in possibility-space. They occasionally offer cryptic warnings or guidance, but their communications are fragmented, arriving out of sequence, and often incomprehensible until events unfold.
