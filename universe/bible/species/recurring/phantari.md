## Physical Description

The Phantari are tall, gaunt humanoids averaging 2.1 meters, with pale translucent skin through which internal organs are faintly visible. Their bodies exist in a state of partial phase-displacement—they're never fully solid, giving them a ghostly, flickering appearance. Their eyes are empty white orbs that seem to look through solid matter.

Their signature ability is phase-shifting: Phantari can become temporarily intangible, passing through solid objects and becoming immune to physical attacks. The shift lasts only seconds and requires recovery time, but those seconds are enough to bypass any security, reach any target, and escape any pursuit.

## Cultural Overview

Phantari society is built around infiltration and assassination. They hire themselves out as the galaxy's premier covert operatives—industrial espionage, political assassination, and strategic sabotage are their specialties. They view solidity as a weakness other species suffer from, and phase-shifting as proof of their evolutionary superiority.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Phantari consider humans soft targets—literally and figuratively. Human security measures are laughably inadequate against beings who can walk through walls. Many high-profile human contestant deaths have Phantari involvement suspected but never proven. They enjoy the challenge of human unpredictability but view humans as prey.
