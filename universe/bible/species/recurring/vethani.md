## Physical Description

The Vethani are tall, graceful humanoids averaging 2.1 meters, with pale blue-gray skin that bears permanent markings—dark brands that cannot be removed, imposed when their species was stripped of Consortium status. Their features are sharp and angular, with large dark eyes that many species find unsettling. Their hands have six fingers, evolved for precision work.

Most distinctive is what's *missing*: Vethani were once bioluminescent, but their light-producing organs were surgically removed as part of their punishment. The scars remain visible, dark striations across their throats and chest where their voices once literally glowed.

## Cultural Overview

The Vethani were once full Consortium members—not founders, but respected participants in galactic governance. Twelve thousand cycles ago, they organized the largest coordinated contestant uprising in recorded history. The rebellion failed. Their punishment was total: homeworld seized, population scattered, children taken for "re-education," adults branded and exiled.

Today's Vethani live in diaspora, clinging to cultural identity through oral tradition. They are not permitted to gather in groups larger than fifty. They cannot own property in most Consortium systems. They serve as a warning: this is what happens when you challenge the games.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Sympathetic/Cautionary

The Vethani recognize themselves in humanity's situation. They watch new contestant species with painful familiarity, seeing the same desperate hope, the same slowly-dawning horror they once experienced. Some Vethani actively assist human survivors—not from optimism, but from solidarity. Others try to warn humans away from rebellion, knowing where that path leads.

They're the galaxy's best resource on what happens when you lose.
