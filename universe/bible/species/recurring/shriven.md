## Physical Description

The Shriven are shadow-adapted humanoids averaging 1.7 meters tall, with matte black skin that absorbs light rather than reflecting it. Their bodies are impossibly thin—almost two-dimensional when viewed from certain angles. Large eyes with no visible whites dominate their narrow faces, reflecting available light like a cat's.

Their most distinctive trait is shadow-merging: Shriven can flatten themselves into any shadow large enough to contain their silhouette, becoming effectively invisible and intangible while merged. They can travel through connected shadows, emerging anywhere darkness touches darkness.

## Cultural Overview

Shriven culture values information above all else. They trade in secrets, surveillance, and strategic intelligence. Their society has no visible hierarchy—or perhaps every Shriven is simply excellent at hiding their true position. They claim to serve no faction, selling equally to all buyers, but their true loyalties (if any) are unknowable.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Shriven find humans interesting subjects for observation. Human social dynamics are complex and emotional, generating valuable intelligence. They neither help nor hinder humans—they watch, record, and sell what they learn to interested parties. Some humans have successfully hired Shriven services; many more have been surveilled without knowing.
