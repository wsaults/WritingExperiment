## Physical Description

The Foundari are massive, heat-resistant beings averaging 2.4 meters tall, with bodies of interlocking stone-like plates covering internal organic systems that burn at extreme temperatures. Their torsos contain biological furnaces—internal chambers where they can smelt raw ore and shape molten metal. Finished items emerge from vents in their arms, born from living fire.

Their eyes glow with the heat of their internal forges, and their movements are deliberate, almost ceremonial. When working, smoke and steam rise from their bodies in rhythmic pulses.

## Cultural Overview

Foundari society measures worth by what you've created. Their internal forges are both literal and metaphorical—each Foundari spends decades developing their unique "flame signature," the precise heat pattern that makes their creations distinctive. Mass production is considered obscene; every item must carry the maker's fire.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Foundari view humans as resourceful but externally dependent—creatures who must build tools to build tools. They neither help nor hinder, but a human who appreciates craftsmanship might earn a Foundari's professional respect. Commissioned work is possible but expensive.
