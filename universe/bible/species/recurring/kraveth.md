## Physical Description

The Kraveth are hulking reptilian bipeds averaging 2.2 meters tall, with thick scaled hides ranging from rust-red to deep bronze. Their bodies are built for combat—broad shoulders, powerful limbs, and a low center of gravity. Their faces feature pronounced brow ridges protecting deep-set yellow eyes, and their jaws contain rows of serrated teeth designed for tearing. Each Kraveth bears ritual scarification patterns across their scales, marking victories and defeats with equal prominence.

Their four-fingered hands end in retractable claws, and a ridge of bony spines runs down their backs. Most notable are their "battle crests"—bioluminescent patches on their throats that flare during combat, signaling aggression levels to allies and enemies alike.

## Cultural Overview

Kraveth society is built entirely around martial excellence. From hatching, individuals are tested, ranked, and assigned to combat roles. They view the games not as entertainment but as the universe's purest expression of worth. Weakness is neither tolerated nor pitied—it is simply eliminated.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Kraveth regard humans as surprisingly entertaining prey. They appreciate human desperation and creativity in combat but consider the species fundamentally inferior. Humans who defeat Kraveth warriors earn grudging respect—and become priority targets for future elimination.
