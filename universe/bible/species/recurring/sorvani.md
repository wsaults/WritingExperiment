## Physical Description

The Sorvani are graceful aquatic-adapted humanoids who can survive in both water and air. They average 1.9 meters tall with sleek, streamlined bodies covered in fine scales that shift from deep blue to pale silver. Their webbed hands contain healing glands. Large, dark eyes dominate their faces, adapted for deep-water vision.

Their most distinctive feature is their "resonance song"—a harmonic vocalization that can accelerate healing in those who hear it. This ability marked them for harvesting centuries ago.

## Cultural Overview

The Sorvani were once game contestants themselves, harvested from their ocean world and forced into aquatic dungeons. After three centuries of exploitation, they were released as "entertainment-exhausted." Now they devote themselves to helping other contestants survive.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Sorvani see their past selves in human contestants. They offer what aid they can, though their refugee status limits their resources. Their sympathy is genuine but colored by fatalism.
