## Physical Description

The Tormak are insectoid warriors standing 1.9 meters tall, with chitinous exoskeletons in mottled black and crimson patterns. Their bodies feature six limbs—four arms and two powerful legs—with the upper arms ending in blade-like appendages evolved for combat. Compound eyes provide 270-degree vision, and their mandibles can crush bone.

What distinguishes them from other insectoids is their lack of hive-mind. Each Tormak is fiercely individual, their society having evolved past collective consciousness into competitive tribalism. Their exoskeletons display kill-marks—chemical scarring that other Tormak can read like battle records.

## Cultural Overview

Tormak live for combat with religious fervor. They believe violence is the universe's method of selecting the worthy, and death in battle guarantees spiritual transcendence. This makes them unpredictable allies—they may switch sides mid-conflict if the losing side offers better fighting.

## Attitude Toward Humans

The Tormak find humans fascinating—fragile creatures who keep winning despite obvious physical inferiority. Some Tormak have developed cult followings around exceptional human contestants, studying their tactics. Others simply want to test themselves against "the soft ones who won't die."
