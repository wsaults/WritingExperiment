## Physical Description

The Vaelthrim are insectoid beings resembling upright mantises, averaging 2.1 meters tall with slender, elegantly segmented bodies. Their exoskeletons display geometric patterns unique to each individual—a biological expression of their cultural emphasis on individuality.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Bipedal insectoid; four arms (two primary, two secondary smaller manipulators)
- Exoskeleton: Iridescent chitin in greens, golds, and blacks; pattern is genetically unique per individual
- Head: Triangular, with large compound eyes that reflect light in rainbow patterns; mandibles adapted for speech
- Wings: Vestigial; ancestors flew, modern Vaelthrim do not (but the wings remain as cultural display)
- Movement: Precise, deliberate; they move like creatures who have considered each step
- Expression: Communicate emotion through wing-position, antenna angle, and exoskeleton color shifts

Their compound eyes process visual information differently than humanoid species—they perceive time more granularly, seeing the galaxy in what others experience as slow motion. This gives them exceptional reflexes but also contributes to their reputation for being "unhurried."

## Cultural Overview

The Vaelthrim were once a hive-mind species. Approximately four million cycles ago, they underwent the **Severance**—a species-wide rejection of collective consciousness in favor of individual awareness. The transition was traumatic, resulting in centuries of chaos, but ultimately produced a civilization that worships personal autonomy as sacred.

This history makes them instinctively suspicious of systems that subsume individual will. The games, which treat contestants as entertainment resources rather than persons, triggers deep cultural revulsion.

**Core Values**:
- *Vael'theri* (Self-Authorship): Every being has the right to write their own story
- *Ther'vaelim* (The Witnessed Choice): Important decisions must be made consciously, not through instinct or external pressure
- *Kori'vael* (Memory of the Hive): Never forget what you escaped

They judge other species not by power or achievement but by how they treat individual choice. Species that value autonomy are respected; species that treat persons as resources are contemptible—regardless of how successful those species are.

## Political Structure

The Concordance operates through radical democracy. Every Vaelthrim has equal voting weight on matters affecting them. No representatives, no proxies, no delegation. This makes their politics impossibly slow by most standards—but also incorruptible.

Leaders emerge through consensus for specific tasks, then return to citizen status when tasks complete. The current Consensus Voice, **Therion'vael**, was chosen specifically to represent Concordance positions in galactic politics and has no domestic authority whatsoever.

This structure reflects their core belief: no one should speak for another without explicit, ongoing consent. The Hive spoke for their ancestors. Never again.

## Relationship to Games/System

The Vaelthrim became founders because their territory controlled critical manufacturing infrastructure. They didn't particularly want founder status—they wanted to be left alone. But neutrality wasn't an option when the System formed, so they chose insider influence over outsider vulnerability.

Their relationship with the games is deeply conflicted. On one hand, contestants who choose to participate and succeed through their own abilities represent *Vael'theri* at its finest. On the other hand, harvested species have no choice—they're conscripted into entertainment against their will.

The Vaelthrim resolve this conflict through reform advocacy. They can't destroy the System (they tried to argue against its formation and lost), but they can push for contestant rights, voluntary participation incentives, and limits on founder exploitation.

Progress has been glacially slow. They persist anyway. What else can they do?

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Neutral/Hopeful

The Vaelthrim don't automatically support humans—automatic support would contradict their emphasis on individual evaluation. Instead, they observe humans closely, assessing each individual's relationship with their own autonomy.

Humans who make conscious choices, even bad ones, earn Vaelthrim respect. Humans who surrender agency to external authorities (governments, factions, even survival instincts) earn Vaelthrim pity.

This creates inconsistent relationships. A Vaelthrim might admire a human contestant who consciously chose a risky strategy and died, while despising a successful human who survived through blind luck and panic.

Their political position favors human rights because harvested species deserve autonomy. But they won't fight specifically for humans—they fight for the principle that applies to humans incidentally.

## Notable Individuals

**Therion'vael** (Consensus Voice): The Vaelthrim's external representative. Chosen for diplomatic skill and patience. Has served for 12,000 cycles—unusually long, suggesting the Concordance wants consistency in galactic politics. Known for asking uncomfortable questions about contestant consent in founder meetings.

**Vael'koris the Heretic**: A philosopher who argues the Severance was a mistake and the Vaelthrim should return to collective consciousness. Considered dangerous by most Vaelthrim, tolerated because silencing heresy would contradict core values. Has attracted a small following among younger generations.

**The First Chooser**: A historical figure, possibly mythologized, who initiated the Severance. Vaelthrim culture treats them as something between founder and saint. Allegedly, the First Chooser's final words were: "Better to die alone than live as one."

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: Consortium Old Guard (founding species membership, reform caucus)
- **Secondary**: The Liberation Collective (philosophical alignment, limited formal support)
- **Opposed**: The Thex Collective (hive-mind species; philosophical nemesis)
- **Complicated**: Other reformist founders (allies on policy, competitors for limited reform energy)

The Vaelthrim vote with reformist founders on most issues but maintain strict independence. They won't join formal alliances that might compromise their ability to evaluate each decision individually. This makes them unreliable partners but intellectually consistent.

Their opposition to the Thex is personal. Everything the Thex represents—collective consciousness, distributed identity, submersion of individual will—triggers Vaelthrim revulsion. They're polite about it. Barely.
