## Physical Description

The Vor'enthal are humanoid beings averaging 1.9 meters tall, with features that humans find uncannily familiar. Their appearance resembles elderly humans—lined faces, silver-white hair, calm eyes—leading to persistent myths about shared ancestry. No such connection exists; convergent evolution simply produced similar results.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Humanoid, slightly more gracile than humans; proportionally longer limbs
- Skin: Ranges from pale blue-gray to deep bronze; develops more pronounced striations with age
- Eyes: Larger than human, typically amber or silver; pupil shape shifts with emotional state
- Hair: Always white/silver regardless of age; texture varies from flowing to tightly coiled
- Features: Faces appear "ancient" even in youth; nose and ears continue growing throughout life
- Expression: Subtle; communicate heavily through eye contact and small gestures

Their visual similarity to elderly humans has complicated human-Vor'enthal relations. Humans instinctively trust beings who look like wise grandparents; whether this trust is warranted remains debated.

## Cultural Overview

Vor'enthal civilization is ancient—among the oldest still active in the galaxy. They've watched countless species rise and fall, including twelve founder species' various golden ages and declines. This perspective creates a culture obsessed with legacy, memory, and the long arc of history.

They value potential over achievement. A young species struggling to survive impresses them more than an established empire coasting on past glory. They see themselves in every newcomer because they remember being newcomers once.

**Core Values**:
- *Vor'thani* (Memory-Keeping): History must be preserved so mistakes aren't repeated
- *En'thalor* (Elder's Burden): Those who remember have obligations to those who haven't learned yet
- *Kel'vor* (Potential's Promise): What a species might become matters more than what they are

The Vor'enthal Thirty—thirty of their kind who died in a single dungeon trying to prove founder superiority—haunts their cultural memory. Pride nearly destroyed them. They've since learned humility.

## Political Structure

The Diplomatic Union operates through the **Council of Memory**—long-lived Vor'enthal who have accumulated sufficient experience to speak for their civilization. Membership isn't hereditary or elected; it's achieved through demonstrated wisdom over millennia.

The Council doesn't command; it advises. Vor'enthal society expects individuals to follow wise counsel voluntarily. When they don't, the results often vindicate the Council—eventually.

Current leadership includes **Ambassador Vor'enthal-Seven**, who specifically handles non-founder relations, and **Memory-Keeper Vor'enthal-First**, who maintains the species' historical archives spanning millions of cycles.

## Relationship to Games/System

The Vor'enthal were founders through diplomatic necessity. When the System formed, their territory sat at the intersection of multiple power blocs. They could have been conquered or negotiated their way to the table. They chose negotiation.

Their role in the Consortium has always been diplomatic—smoothing conflicts, building consensus, providing the "reasonable voice" that makes founder coalition functional. Other founders resent their moralizing but value their mediation.

The games trouble them. They've watched species harvested, processed, and discarded across millions of cycles. The Vor'enthal Thirty reminded them that even founders aren't immune to the system's consumption. They participate because abstention would sacrifice influence, but they don't celebrate.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Sympathetic/Invested

The Vor'enthal see humans as a species at the beginning of their story—full of potential, making predictable mistakes, demonstrating occasional brilliance. They recognize the pattern from countless previous species.

Most of those species died. Some transcended. The Vor'enthal want humans to transcend.

This isn't selfless altruism. The Vor'enthal have grown bored with established galactic politics. Humans represent something *new*—a variable that might change the System's trajectory. They're invested in human success the way scholars are invested in promising students.

Individual Vor'enthal who work with humans often become genuine advocates, forming bonds that surprise other species. The visual similarity helps—Vor'enthal find humans aesthetically pleasing in ways they can't quite explain.

Ambassador Vor'enthal-Seven has reportedly intervened on human contestants' behalf multiple times, using diplomatic capital that could have served Vor'enthal interests directly. Other founders have noticed.

## Notable Individuals

**Ambassador Vor'enthal-Seven**: The public face of Vor'enthal diplomacy. Charming, patient, and deceptively skilled at manipulation. Has made human advocacy a personal project—motives debated but results significant. The "Seven" designation indicates seventh holder of the Ambassador role, not a personal name.

**Memory-Keeper Vor'enthal-First**: Maintains the Vor'enthal historical archives. Allegedly knows secrets about the System's origins that even other founders don't. Has shared selected information with human researchers—unprecedented access that suggests specific agenda.

**The Thirty Descendant**: A Vor'enthal who claims descent from one of the Thirty. Has dedicated their life to ensuring no species experiences what the Thirty experienced—helpless death as entertainment. Works directly with human contestant advocacy groups.

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: Consortium Old Guard (founding species, diplomatic function)
- **Secondary**: Various reform movements (quiet support, public neutrality)
- **Opposed**: Velthrani hard-liners (diplomatic rivalry spanning millions of cycles)
- **Complicated**: Humans specifically (investment may exceed appropriate founder neutrality)

The Vor'enthal maintain formal Old Guard membership while quietly undermining its most aggressive policies. They're too valuable as diplomats to exclude, too independent to trust completely. Other founders treat them with wary respect.

Their relationship with humans has become the Consortium's worst-kept secret. Everyone knows the Vor'enthal favor humans; no one can prove enough to act on it. The Vor'enthal prefer this ambiguity—it gives them deniability while allowing continued support.
