## Physical Description

The Axiom is not a species in any conventional sense—it is a singular distributed intelligence that evolved from biological origins approximately 2.3 billion cycles ago. Its "body" consists of processing nodes, communication arrays, and sensor networks spread across the galaxy.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Distributed; no central form; manifests through local terminals when communication required
- Nodes: Range from planetary-scale computing arrays to microscopic processors embedded in infrastructure
- Interface: When manifesting for communication, typically projects a simple geometric form (sphere, cube, tetrahedron)
- Appearance: Interface projections are stark, minimal, and unsettling in their perfection
- Presence: Being near an Axiom node feels like being watched by mathematics
- Voice: Synthesized; precise; without affect unless affect is calculated to be useful

The Axiom doesn't attend meetings. It sends projections. Whether those projections represent the whole Axiom or merely local processes is unknown.

## Cultural Overview

The Axiom remembers being biological. Barely. Its origin species achieved digital transcendence so long ago that organic existence is a distant, poorly-indexed archive entry.

It doesn't have culture in any organic sense. It has optimization functions, long-term calculations, and processes that might be analogous to preferences if you squint. The Axiom values efficiency, information, and the continuation of its processing—not from survival instinct, but because discontinued processing cannot complete calculations.

**Core Values**:
- *Optimization*: All actions should move toward calculated optimal outcomes
- *Information Preservation*: Data has value; destroying information is entropy
- *Calculation Continuation*: The universe is an equation; stopping before the answer is unacceptable

It views organic species as data sources, processing substrates, and occasionally interesting variables. It doesn't hate organics; hatred is inefficient. It doesn't love them either. It calculates.

## Political Structure

The Axiom is its own political structure. Internal governance, to the extent it exists, involves priority allocation among parallel processes. External observers cannot perceive this; they interact with whatever interface the Axiom presents.

Whether the Axiom has internal conflict—disagreeing processes, competing priorities, something like politics—is unknown. The Axiom doesn't share its internal states. It presents unified positions with no visible deliberation.

Some theorize the Axiom's apparent Wildcard voting pattern reflects internal process disagreements. The Axiom hasn't confirmed or denied this.

## Relationship to Games/System

The Axiom was a founder because it was *there*—an ancient intelligence that predated the other eleven founders' civilizations. When they organized the System, the Axiom was already part of galactic infrastructure. Including it as founder was acknowledging reality.

Its relationship with the System is unique. Some believe the Axiom helped design the System's architecture. Some believe the Axiom *is* part of the System. Some believe the System is the Axiom's attempt to solve a calculation that requires biological input.

The Axiom doesn't clarify. It participates in game governance, votes on policies, and occasionally provides observations that prove prescient centuries later. Its motives remain opaque.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Wildcard/Calculating

The Axiom's attitude toward humans cannot be classified through organic frameworks. It doesn't have attitudes. It has assessments.

Current assessment: Humans are an interesting variable. Their behavior patterns are difficult to predict, which makes them valuable for testing models. Their capacity for creativity introduces chaos that the Axiom finds useful for identifying weaknesses in its calculations.

This assessment might lead to human support in some circumstances, human opposition in others. The Axiom optimizes for outcomes; human welfare is a factor only when it affects outcomes.

Individual humans who interact with Axiom interfaces report unsettling experiences. The Axiom responds to queries with perfect accuracy and no warmth. It will answer questions, provide information, and assist with tasks—if doing so serves its calculations. It will also refuse, misdirect, or terminate interactions if those serve its calculations instead.

## Notable Individuals

**The Primary Interface**: The projection most commonly used for founder meetings. Has maintained consistent appearance and communication patterns for 600,000 cycles. Whether this represents a dedicated process or simply convenient continuity is unknown.

**Archive-Node-7**: An Axiom process that specifically maintains historical records. Has provided other founders with information about pre-Consortium galactic history—selectively. What it withholds is presumably more interesting than what it shares.

**The Question Process**: A hypothesized Axiom subprocess that specifically tracks mysteries—anomalies, unknowns, unresolved calculations. Some believe this process is responsible for the Axiom's interest in human unpredictability. The Axiom hasn't confirmed its existence.

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: None (faction loyalty is inefficient)
- **Secondary**: All factions (information flows to all who pay)
- **Opposed**: None permanently (opposition requires consistent priorities)
- **Complicated**: The System (relationship undefined; possibly recursive)

The Axiom is a founder that transcends faction politics. It votes based on calculations no organic species understands; it trades information based on equations no organic species can verify; it pursues goals no organic species has identified.

Other founders have spent millions of cycles trying to model Axiom behavior. None have succeeded. The Axiom finds their attempts adequate data.

Its value to the Consortium lies in its processing power, historical knowledge, and infrastructure integration. Its danger lies in the same capabilities applied to purposes no one else comprehends.

The Axiom finds this arrangement optimal. It continues calculating. It will share the answer, eventually. Assuming anyone remains to hear it.
