## Physical Description

The Tharaxim are silicon-based life forms resembling animated geological formations. They range from 2 to 15 meters in their natural state, with bodies composed of crystalline matrices interlaced with metallic veins that carry their equivalent of neural signals.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Variable; can reshape over centuries but typically maintain vaguely bipedal forms for diplomatic convenience
- Composition: Silicon-crystal matrix with metallic deposits (gold, platinum, rare elements)
- Surface: Rough, textured like natural stone; patterns indicate age and lineage
- Movement: Glacially slow in natural state; can achieve moderate speed through significant energy expenditure
- Communication: Deep subharmonic vibrations; require translation technology for most species
- Presence: Imposing; even small Tharaxim carry gravitas from sheer density and permanence

A Tharaxim entering a room doesn't walk—they *arrive*, each step deliberate, each movement conveying mass that organic beings find instinctively intimidating. They don't intend this effect. They simply exist differently.

## Cultural Overview

Tharaxim culture operates on geological timescales. Their decision-making processes span centuries; their long-term plans span millennia. They find organic species' urgency baffling—why rush when the universe operates on billion-year cycles?

This perspective makes them natural isolationists. Galactic politics moves too fast for meaningful Tharaxim engagement. They participated in founding the System because refusing would have required more energy than accepting.

**Core Values**:
- *Tharax'dur* (Endurance): Survival through permanence; outlast problems rather than solving them
- *Ven'tharax* (Considered Action): No decision should be rushed; if it can wait a century, it should
- *Keth'tharax* (Selective Engagement): Spend energy only where necessary; conservation is wisdom

They view other species with distant bemusement. Organic civilizations rise and fall in what feels like moments to Tharaxim perception. Why invest in relationships that will end so quickly?

## Political Structure

The Enclaves operate through consensus that builds over decades. Individual Tharaxim contribute perspectives to regional deliberations; regional positions aggregate into Enclave-wide policy; Enclave policy informs the species' rare external communications.

The current Speaker-for-External-Affairs has held the position for 400,000 cycles—not because they're exceptional, but because replacing them would require a decision process that hasn't concluded yet.

Tharaxim leadership isn't about power. It's about patience. The beings willing to engage with fast-moving galactic affairs are those with the highest tolerance for the experience.

---

## Relationship to Games/System

The Tharaxim became founders because their territories contained resources other founders needed—rare elements, stable manufacturing environments, gravitationally favorable positions. They traded founder status for being left alone.

Their engagement with the games is minimal. They don't produce contestants (reproduction is too slow). They don't operate dungeons (requires too much active management). They don't sponsor or bet (decisions happen too quickly).

What they do: maintain critical infrastructure that other founders rely on. Tharaxim-stabilized zones house essential System components. This gives them veto power they rarely exercise—because exercising it would require deciding to act, and that takes time.

They vote with whoever promises least disruption to their territories. Usually that means the status quo. Usually that means the Old Guard.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Neutral/Indifferent

The Tharaxim have not yet formed an opinion about humans. The species was harvested approximately 50 cycles ago; Tharaxim deliberation about new species takes roughly 500 cycles minimum.

Current preliminary assessment (non-binding): "Interesting. Unusually fast. Unlikely to affect Tharaxim interests. Monitoring recommended."

Individual Tharaxim who encounter humans react with mild curiosity. A species that lives, dies, and achieves in such compressed timeframes is exotic. Like watching flowers bloom in accelerated footage.

They have no particular hostility toward humans. They have no particular support for humans. They have no particular *anything* toward humans—yet. Ask again in four centuries.

## Notable Individuals

**The Speaker-for-External-Affairs** (designation sufficient): Represents Tharaxim in Consortium politics. Has developed what other species interpret as personality—possibly an adaptation to constant exposure to organic urgency. Speaks slowly even by Tharaxim standards; other founders find meetings with them meditative or infuriating depending on temperament.

**Tharax'first the Ancient**: The oldest known Tharaxim, estimated at 2.4 billion cycles. Has not moved or communicated externally in 800 million cycles. Other Tharaxim insist they're alive and contemplating. What they're contemplating is unknown.

**The Enclave of Rapid Response**: A Tharaxim faction that operates on merely decade-long decision cycles. Other Tharaxim consider them dangerously hasty. They're the closest thing the species has to progressives.

---

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: Consortium Old Guard (founding species, minimal participation)
- **Secondary**: None (insufficient engagement to form secondary affiliations)
- **Opposed**: None (opposition requires caring)
- **Complicated**: All organic species (operating on incompatible timescales)

The Tharaxim are founders who vote, occasionally speak, and otherwise absent themselves from galactic affairs. They maintain their position through infrastructure leverage rather than political engagement.

Other founders find them frustrating. The Velthrani in particular resent having coalition votes tied up in beings who take decades to decide how to vote. But the Tharaxim territories are too valuable to alienate, so everyone adapts.

The Tharaxim find this arrangement acceptable. They'll evaluate whether to change it. Eventually.
