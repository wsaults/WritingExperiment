## Physical Description

The Harken are massive bipedal predators averaging 2.8 meters tall and 400 kilograms, with bodies optimized for pursuit hunting across millions of years of evolution. Their appearance combines feline grace with reptilian durability—scaled hide, powerful limbs, and mouths filled with serrated teeth designed for tearing prey.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Massive bipedal predator; heavily muscled with digitigrade legs
- Hide: Thick scaled skin ranging from mottled grey-green to deep bronze; scars are status symbols
- Head: Elongated skull with powerful jaw muscles; eyes positioned forward for depth perception
- Limbs: Four-fingered hands with retractable claws; can run on all fours for bursts of speed
- Size: Imposing; even "small" Harken tower over most species
- Presence: Radiates threat; prey species feel instinctive fear response in their presence

Their biology screams apex predator. Even other hostile species feel uncomfortable around Harken—some ancestral warning system firing despite millions of years of civilization.

## Cultural Overview

Harken civilization emerged from pack-hunting social structures. Status comes from proven hunting skill, territorial control, and the number of challenging prey successfully taken. Their entire society is organized around the hunt.

This predatory worldview translates directly into politics. They view other species through hunter/prey/rival frameworks. Weak species are prey (potentially entertaining). Strong species are either pack or competition. The Velthrani are pack—not because Harken respect them, but because alliance serves mutual interests.

**Core Values**:
- *Har'thani* (The Hunt): Life without challenge is death; hunting provides meaning
- *Keth'harken* (Worthy Prey): Respect is earned through being dangerous; weakness is contemptible
- *Vor'harken* (Pack Loyalty): Allies are protected; betrayal is punished by being demoted to prey status

They view other species through predatory pragmatism. Every being is either useful, dangerous, or food. Usually they're polite enough not to say this directly.

## Political Structure

The Harken are governed by the **Alpha Council**—a collection of clan leaders who've proven dominance through combat, hunting achievement, and political maneuvering (which they consider another form of hunting).

The current Supreme Alpha, **Harken'vor the Scar-Bearer**, has held power for 50,000 cycles through a combination of unmatched hunting records and brutal efficiency in eliminating rivals. Leadership transitions are often bloody; this is considered natural.

Beneath the Alphas, Harken society stratifies into hunting clans, each controlling territory and competing for status through prey quality and quantity.

## Relationship to Games/System

The Harken embraced the games immediately upon their founding. Here was hunting refined to an art form—challenging prey, controlled environments, and audiences to witness their superiority. The games are everything Harken culture values, packaged for entertainment.

They were founders because they controlled vital resource-rich territories and because their military capabilities made them dangerous enemies. The other founders invited them to the table rather than fight them for it.

Harken engage enthusiastically with game operations. They run some of the most challenging and lethal dungeons in the galaxy—environments designed by predators to test prey. Contestants who survive Harken dungeons earn genuine Harken respect. Most don't survive.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Hostile/Interested

The Harken consider humans *excellent* prey. Small, soft, lacking natural weapons—but clever, unpredictable, and occasionally dangerous in ways that surprise. This makes hunting them satisfying.

Their hostility isn't hatred; it's predatory interest. A Harken doesn't hate the deer it hunts. It respects prey that provides challenge. Humans who fight back, who survive through cunning, who make the hunt interesting—these earn Harken approval even as the Harken tries to kill them.

This creates bizarre dynamics. A Harken might sponsor a human contestant's success, then attempt to hunt that same human personally. To the Harken, these aren't contradictions—they're raising worthy prey.

Individual Harken who interact with humans often express what other species would call respect. "You are weak but clever," a Harken might say. "You would provide excellent sport." This is meant as a compliment.

## Notable Individuals

**Harken'vor the Scar-Bearer** (Supreme Alpha): Leader of the Harken Clans. Personally hunted over 200 species to extinction before such practices were regulated. Now channels hunting instincts into game operations and Consortium politics. Considers the Velthrani useful allies and humans promising prey.

**Keth'harken the Teacher**: A Harken who trains contestants in survival skills—an unusual position that draws criticism from traditionalists. Argues that better-trained prey provides better hunting. Has developed grudging respect for human adaptability.

**The Last Hunt Master**: An ancient Harken who controls the most lethal dungeon in Harken territory. Rumored to have never let a contestant survive. Whether this is skill or cheating is disputed; the Harken consider the distinction meaningless.

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: Consortium Old Guard (founding species, traditionalist bloc)
- **Secondary**: Velthrani-led Coalition (hunting partnership; shared interests in game difficulty)
- **Opposed**: The Liberation Collective (contestant welfare reduces hunting quality)
- **Complicated**: Reform movements (some reforms might create more interesting hunting scenarios)

The Harken vote with the Velthrani Coalition on most issues because their interests align: difficult games, disposable contestants, and founder privilege that enables satisfying hunting. They're not ideologically committed to Velthrani leadership—they simply find the arrangement beneficial.

If circumstances changed, the Harken would shift allegiances without sentiment. Loyalty to the pack extends only as far as the pack serves Harken interests.
