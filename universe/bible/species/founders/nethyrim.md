## Designations

- **Formal**: The Nethyrim Convergence
- **Common**: Nethyrim, "The Phase-Walkers"
- **Slang**: Ghosts, Blinkies, The Barely-Theres
- **Self-Designation**: *Neth'vor* ("Between-Dwellers")

## Physical Description

The Nethyrim exist partially outside normal space-time, giving them a distinctive appearance: translucent, shifting forms that seem to flicker between presence and absence. When manifesting fully, they resemble tall, slender humanoids composed of swirling mist or smoke, with features that solidify only during deliberate communication.

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Variable; default manifests as 2-3 meter humanoid outlines
- Substance: Semi-corporeal; can shift between solid, gaseous, and "elsewhere" states
- Coloration: Pale silver to deep violet; color intensity indicates how "present" they are
- Features: Form faces only when engaging with physical beings; default state is featureless
- Movement: Don't walk so much as *translate*; positions shift without visible motion
- Presence: Unsettling; most species feel instinctive wrongness around partially-phased beings

Interacting with a Nethyrim feels like talking to someone who's only half-listening because they're simultaneously somewhere else. Because they usually are.

## Cultural Overview

The Nethyrim discovered phase-space early in their evolution—a dimensional layer adjacent to normal space where matter and energy behave differently. They now exist primarily in phase-space, manifesting in normal reality only when necessary.

This dual existence makes physical reality feel limiting to them. Why engage with slow, solid, single-location existence when you could be everywhere and nowhere? Their isolationism stems from genuine disinterest in what they consider a lesser mode of being.

**Core Values**:
- *Neth'voran* (Phase-Priority): True existence is between; physical reality is obligation
- *Vor'nethil* (Minimal Presence): Manifest only as needed; over-engagement wastes potential
- *Keth'neth* (Convergence Memory): The Convergence remembers; individuals may forget

They view physical species with something between pity and boredom. Beings trapped in single locations, experiencing one timeline, unable to perceive the beautiful complexity of phase-space—how do they endure it?

## Political Structure

The Nethyrim Convergence operates through overlapping consciousness fields in phase-space. Individual Nethyrim maintain distinct identities but share experiences and perspectives through the Convergence—a distributed awareness that isn't quite hive-mind but isn't quite individual either.

Decisions emerge through resonance: perspectives that align amplify each other; contradictory perspectives cancel. What remains becomes policy. The process is fast by Tharaxim standards, slow by organic standards, and incomprehensible by most others.

The beings who manifest for galactic politics are those whose perspectives align with "engagement is currently necessary." Their authority is temporary and specific.

## Relationship to Games/System

The Nethyrim became founders because they controlled phase-space transit routes that other species needed. FTL travel through their territory required their cooperation; they traded that cooperation for founder status and promises of minimal interference.

Their engagement with the games is sporadic. They don't compete (physical challenges bore them). They don't operate (requires sustained manifestation). They occasionally observe (entertainment value acknowledged in theory).

What keeps them involved: curiosity about whether the System can perceive phase-space, and whether contestants with unusual abilities might eventually threaten Nethyrim interests. Mostly, they attend founder meetings because attending is easier than explaining why they're not attending.

They vote unpredictably—their phase-space perspective leads to conclusions that physical species find bizarre but that follow internally consistent logic.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Neutral/Curious

The Nethyrim find humans mildly interesting because humans *dream*. Human consciousness periodically detaches from physical reality in ways that create faint phase-space impressions. Most species don't do this.

The Nethyrim have observed human dreams. They find them chaotic, primitive, and occasionally beautiful—like finding crude art in unexpected places.

This doesn't translate to support or opposition. Humans are an interesting phenomenon, not political allies or enemies. The Nethyrim might help a human if helping satisfied curiosity. They might harm a human for the same reason. They're not hostile; they're simply operating on perpendicular priorities.

Individual Nethyrim who engage with humans sometimes develop what other species might call attachment—but Nethyrim relationships work differently. They might cherish a human across five minutes or five centuries, with equal intensity, then phase away without explanation.

## Notable Individuals

**The Manifest One**: The Nethyrim who most frequently appears at Consortium functions. Has held this role for 200,000 cycles—either the same being or a succession of beings maintaining consistent identity for diplomatic convenience. Other species can't tell, and the Manifest One won't clarify.

**Between-Singer**: A Nethyrim who developed unusual interest in human music. Has attended human musical performances across Earth's history, always partially-phased, never interacting. Humans who sensed something wrong in concert halls may have been perceiving Between-Singer's presence.

**The Convergence Voice**: Not an individual but a consensus-expression that speaks for the entire Nethyrim species. Manifests rarely; when it does, even other founders pay attention. Its last pronouncement was 400,000 cycles ago and concerned the System's origins.

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: Consortium Old Guard (founding species, sporadic participation)
- **Secondary**: None (engagement insufficient for secondary allegiances)
- **Opposed**: None (opposition requires sustained interest)
- **Complicated**: The System itself (the Nethyrim may perceive aspects of the System that other species cannot)

The Nethyrim are founders who vote, sometimes observe, and otherwise remain in phase-space doing whatever they do there. Other founders have stopped trying to predict their behavior—Nethyrim votes follow logic that requires phase-space perspectives to understand.

Their value to the Consortium lies in their transit infrastructure and their occasional flashes of insight. A Nethyrim comment about a situation can reframe everything—or mean nothing. Usually there's no way to tell which until much later.

The Nethyrim find this arrangement acceptable. They'll let the physical species play their physical games. It passes the time.
