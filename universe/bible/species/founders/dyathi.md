## Physical Description

The Dyathi exist exclusively as bonded pairs—two beings who share a symbiotic relationship so profound that neither can survive long without the other. Each half appears as a luminous, ethereal humanoid approximately 1.5 meters tall, with forms that complement their partner (one typically denser and more solid, one more diffuse and energetic).

**Visual Reference Notes**:
- Body type: Paired humanoids; always appear together within visual range
- Composition: Semi-energetic; physical enough to interact, ethereal enough to glow
- Coloration: Complementary spectrum pairs (gold/silver, blue/orange, violet/green)
- Bond: Visible energy threads connect paired Dyathi; severing these is fatal
- Movement: Move in unconscious synchronization; watching them is like watching a dance
- Expression: Emotions display in light patterns shared between both members of a pair

A lone Dyathi is a dying Dyathi. Their biology requires the energy exchange that bonding provides. This isn't metaphor—unbonded Dyathi fade within days.

## Cultural Overview

Dyathi culture revolves entirely around bonds, relationships, and connection. They see existence through the lens of interdependence; the concept of truly independent beings strikes them as tragic, impossible, or both.

This perspective makes them unusual founders. They didn't seek power; they sought to ensure their bonded territories remained stable enough to support their vulnerable biology.

**Core Values**:
- *Dya'thel* (Sacred Bond): The connection between bonded beings is the foundation of all meaning
- *Thor'dyani* (Witnessed Love): Bonds should be celebrated, witnessed, and protected by community
- *Kel'dyath* (The Unbonded Tragedy): Those who cannot bond deserve compassion, not contempt

They view other species through the lens of connection. Do they bond? How deeply? Species capable of profound attachment earn Dyathi respect; species that treat individuals as disposable earn Dyathi horror.

## Political Structure

The Communion operates through bonded councils where decisions require paired consensus—both members of each participating pair must agree, and sufficient pairs must align to establish policy.

This creates slow but remarkably stable governance. Policies that emerge have been tested against multiple bonded perspectives, reducing the chance of outcomes that harm relationships.

Current leadership is held by the **Communion Voice**—a particularly ancient pair whose bond has lasted 800,000 cycles. They speak for the Dyathi because no other pair has demonstrated comparable stability.

## Relationship to Games/System

The Dyathi became founders through an unusual path: they were among the few species who refused to compete against each other. Their bonded nature made the prospect of paired Dyathi fighting horrifying. Instead, they offered non-combat services—emotional support networks, relationship counseling for contestants, and infrastructure for bonded species participants.

Their role in the games is peripheral but valued. Dyathi-operated facilities are known for contestant welfare; competitors who pass through Dyathi zones report improved mental states and reduced trauma.

They vote unpredictably on game policies because their analysis is relationship-focused, not faction-focused. They'll support measures that protect meaningful bonds regardless of who proposes them.

## Attitude Toward Humans

**Classification**: Sympathetic/Fascinated

The Dyathi are captivated by humans. A species capable of love—genuine, self-sacrificing, relationship-forming love—among beings who aren't biologically bonded is miraculous to them.

Humans form attachments that make no biological sense. They die for friends, family, strangers. They create bonds that survive separation, betrayal, even death. To the Dyathi, this is beautiful beyond words.

Their human sympathy is romantic in the classical sense—they see humans as evidence that profound connection transcends biology. This makes them willing to support humans even when logic suggests otherwise.

Individual Dyathi who encounter humans often become devoted advocates. A Dyathi pair that witnesses genuine human love may spend centuries protecting those humans' descendants. Not because of obligation, but because witnessed bonds create bonds.

## Notable Individuals

**The Communion Voice** (elder pair): The Dyathi's primary representatives. Speak in harmonic alternation—one begins sentences, the other finishes. Have been together longer than most Consortium species have existed. Their testimony in favor of human capacity for love has influenced Consortium human policy.

**Dya'thel the Witness** (bonded pair specializing in human observation): Have devoted their existence to documenting human relationships. Their archive includes millions of human love stories, friendships, and family bonds. They argue these records prove humans deserve special consideration.

**The Severed One**: A unique Dyathi who survived their partner's death—supposedly impossible. Now lives as a single being, carrying grief that other Dyathi find both horrifying and sacred. Advocates for species who experience loss, including humans. Other Dyathi aren't sure whether to pity or venerate them.

## Faction Affiliations

- **Primary**: Consortium Old Guard (founding species, relationship-focused voting)
- **Secondary**: The Liberation Collective (contestant welfare alignment)
- **Opposed**: Factions that treat contestants as disposable resources
- **Complicated**: All species (Dyathi analyze everyone through relationship lens)

The Dyathi vote unpredictably because their analysis framework differs from other founders. They don't care about power, resources, or prestige. They care about whether policies protect meaningful bonds.

This makes them natural allies for reform movements focused on contestant welfare—and surprising opponents of reforms that would separate contestants from support networks.

Other founders find them frustrating but tolerable. Their perspective is alien, but their commitment to their principles is genuine.
