# Prose Examples: Templates and Annotations

## Action Scene Templates

### Example 1: Combat with Multiple Enemies (~650 words)

---

Three of them. The corridor had been empty thirty seconds ago, and now it very much wasn't.

[ANNOTATION: Open with immediate situational awareness. Short sentence establishes threat. Second sentence uses contrast for impact.]

The System helpfully labeled them: [Gristlemaw, Level 7], [Gristlemaw, Level 5], [Gristlemaw, Level 8 (Alpha)]. Four legs, two arms, a mouth that looked like someone had weaponized a garbage disposal. The Alpha had scarring across its face and moved with the caution of something that had earned those scars.

[ANNOTATION: Introduce enemies with visual details that matter tactically. The Alpha's scars telegraph experience—it's not just numerically stronger, it's smarter. One concrete simile per description maximum.]

The Level 5 charged first. They always did—the weakest in a pack had something to prove. I sidestepped, let its momentum carry it past me, and drove my blade into the gap between its second and third neck vertebrae. It collapsed mid-stride.

[ANNOTATION: First kill is quick and efficient. Demonstrates competence without extended description. "They always did" shows pattern recognition. Anatomical specificity grounds the action.]

One down. The Alpha hadn't moved.

That was the problem with experienced predators. They learned.

[ANNOTATION: Brief beat between action sequences. Short paragraphs for pacing. The Alpha's restraint raises stakes—this fight won't follow the easy pattern.]

The Level 7 came from my left, faster than the first, learning from its packmate's mistake. It didn't overcommit. Its claws caught my forearm as I pivoted, three lines of fire across my skin, and I realized I'd been baited.

[ANNOTATION: Protagonist takes damage. Injuries happen. "Three lines of fire" is visceral but brief—we feel it, then move on. "Baited" shows tactical awareness.]

The Alpha was already in motion.

[ANNOTATION: Short sentence punch. The previous paragraph set up this reveal.]

My Analyze skill updated in real-time, which was helpful in the same way that watching your bank account drain during a disaster was helpful. [Level 8 Gristlemaw (Alpha) - THREAT ASSESSMENT: SEVERE - RECOMMENDED ACTION: RETREAT]

Retreating would have been great. The corridor had one exit, and I wasn't faster than them.

[ANNOTATION: System information integrated naturally. Sarcastic comparison maintains voice. Tactical reality counters "helpful" advice.]

I activated Resonant Strike and met the Alpha's charge.

[ANNOTATION: Skill activation is simple declaration—no elaborate casting sequences. The skill name tells readers what it does; future strikes will hit harder.]

Claws versus blade. The math wasn't in my favor, but math didn't account for the dungeon's uneven flooring. The Alpha's rear leg caught on a stone lip—just a moment's instability, maybe half a second.

Half a second was enough.

[ANNOTATION: Environmental factors matter. Victory comes from observation and exploitation, not raw power. "Half a second was enough" creates tension then releases it.]

My blade found its throat. The Resonant Strike bonus added seven percent to my damage, stacking on the nothing I'd done to the Alpha before, but the strike itself was clean. It dropped.

[ANNOTATION: Skill mechanics mentioned casually—engaged readers can track the system, casual readers get "blade found its throat." The protagonist acknowledges the skill was almost irrelevant here.]

The Level 7 hesitated. Watched its Alpha die. Whatever pack hierarchy governed these things, witnessing the top of that hierarchy die from a bleeding human seemed to cause a recomputation error.

[ANNOTATION: Moment of vulnerability in the remaining enemy. Tech vocabulary ("recomputation error") reinforces protagonist's worldview.]

I didn't give it time to finish processing.

[ANNOTATION: Protagonist exploits hesitation. No mercy, no drawn-out final confrontation.]

The System notification appeared before the body hit the ground: [Victory! +847 Progression. Bonus: +212 (Style Points)]

I leaned against the corridor wall, blood dripping from my forearm onto the dungeon floor, and considered the phrase "style points."

Either the viewing audience appreciated economy of motion, or they just really liked watching things die.

Probably both.

[ANNOTATION: Post-combat beat. Protagonist is injured, not triumphant. System reward prompts sardonic reflection. Ends on character voice, not action.]

---

### Example 2: Boss Encounter (~700 words)

---

The chamber door sealed behind me. Because of course it did.

[ANNOTATION: Opening acknowledges genre convention with resignation rather than surprise.]

The Guardian waited at the chamber's center—thirty feet of crystalline horror arranged in a shape that hurt to look at directly. My eyes kept trying to track its edges and failing, like watching an optical illusion that wanted to kill me.

[ANNOTATION: Boss introduction emphasizes wrongness over specific anatomy. "Like watching an optical illusion" grounds the abstract in relatable experience.]

[Floor Guardian: Prismatic Wraith, Level 15]
[Note: This entity exists partially outside standard dimensional constraints. Attacks may originate from unexpected vectors.]

Great. The System was telling me the boss could cheat physics. That seemed fair.

[ANNOTATION: System note provides crucial tactical information. Protagonist's response is dry acceptance, not complaint.]

The Wraith moved. "Moved" was inadequate—it *translated*, somehow occupying a different position without crossing the intervening space. The attack came from behind me despite the creature being in front of me.

I rolled sideways on instinct. The space where I'd been standing shattered like glass, leaving a void that slowly refilled with normal reality.

[ANNOTATION: Abstract threat made concrete through effects. Void/shattering imagery establishes danger. "Slowly refilled with normal reality" implies wrongness.]

One hit and I'd be un-existed. Good to know the stakes.

[ANNOTATION: Stakes clarified immediately. Dark humor ("un-existed") maintains voice under pressure.]

I circled, watching for patterns. Everything had patterns. Even things that existed partially outside standard dimensional constraints had to follow *some* rules, or the System wouldn't be able to assign them levels.

[ANNOTATION: Protagonist applies systematic thinking. The logic is sound—levels imply quantifiable rules. This is how an engineer approaches magic.]

The Wraith translated again. This time I watched its reflection in a polished floor tile, and that worked somehow—the reflected image moved normally while the actual creature broke physics. The attack came from my reflection's perspective.

[ANNOTATION: Discovery through observation. The solution is clever but logical given the established problem. Protagonist adapts mid-combat.]

Three more translations. I dodged using the reflection trick, taking small cuts from secondary attacks but avoiding the reality-erasing ones. My Stamina bar dipped below fifty percent.

[ANNOTATION: Combat summary without blow-by-blow tedium. Stakes tracked through resource drain.]

Approach using reflections. Attack the reflection instead of the creature?

Worth trying. Dying was the alternative.

[ANNOTATION: Hypothesis formation under pressure. Brief internal logic. "Dying was the alternative" adds dark stakes.]

I positioned myself at an angle where the floor tile showed the Wraith's "real" position—the place where normal physics said it should be. Then I attacked the tile.

My blade passed through polished stone like it was water, somehow reaching *through* the reflection and into whatever dimensional pocket the Wraith actually occupied.

The creature screamed in frequencies I felt more than heard. Its crystalline form cracked.

[ANNOTATION: The plan works—readers get satisfaction. The attack feels earned because the logic was established. Sensory description emphasizes alien nature.]

Three more reflection-attacks. Each one harder than the last as the Wraith adapted, started moving faster, made the angles more difficult. I caught a glancing blow that took a chunk out of my reality—my left hand flickered for a moment, pixels missing from my fingers like a corrupted image file.

[ANNOTATION: Boss adapts—raises stakes for climax. Injury described in tech terms that match protagonist's perception. Visceral wrongness without gore.]

The final strike.

My blade found the Wraith's core through a reflection in my own blood pooling on the floor. Poetic, if you were into that sort of thing. I preferred "functional."

[ANNOTATION: Climactic blow. The blood-reflection detail is specific without being gratuitously dark. Protagonist undercuts potential melodrama.]

[Floor Guardian Defeated! Exceptional Performance!]
[+3,400 Progression]
[Achievement Unlocked: Lateral Thinking (Exploited dimensional vulnerabilities using environmental observation)]
[Loot: Prismatic Shard (Rare)]

I sat on the chamber floor, hand still flickering slightly, and tried to remember what having a stable grasp on reality felt like.

[ANNOTATION: Post-victory beat focuses on cost rather than triumph. Ongoing injury consequences. Quiet moment to process.]

The door on the far side of the chamber unsealed.

Progress.

[ANNOTATION: Forward momentum maintained. Single-word final line lands clean.]

---

### Example 3: Environmental Hazard Escape (~550 words)

---

The dungeon was flooding. Not metaphorically. Actual water, rising at a rate that suggested the System thought "tension" and "drowning" were synonyms.

[ANNOTATION: Immediate threat. Second sentence adds dark humor about the System's design philosophy.]

I had maybe four minutes before the water reached the ceiling. The exit was three chambers away.

Math time. Each chamber took approximately ninety seconds to clear under normal conditions. Normal conditions didn't include waist-deep water and rising panic.

[ANNOTATION: Time pressure quantified. Protagonist applies analytical framing to existential threat.]

The first chamber's obstacles—blade pendulums, because this dungeon loved classics—swung at their normal rhythm. The water hadn't reached them yet. I timed my runs, cleared the pattern, and entered chamber two with three minutes remaining.

[ANNOTATION: First obstacle handled efficiently. Brief description maintains pace. Time tracking creates urgency.]

Chamber two was worse. The water here was already chest-high, and the trap mechanism was pressure plates. Every step created risk. One wrong plate and the ceiling would—

The ceiling started descending.

I'd stepped on the wrong plate.

[ANNOTATION: Setback raises stakes. Short sentences punch. Protagonist isn't infallible.]

The ceiling's descent wasn't fast. The dungeon wanted tension, not instant death. I had maybe ninety seconds before it reached the water, and then things would get complicated in ways that ended with me compressed into a thin paste.

[ANNOTATION: System's entertainment motives explain the pacing. Dark description of potential failure.]

I moved. Not carefully anymore—careful was a luxury for people who weren't about to become dungeon pulp.

The water dragged at my legs. The pressure plates shifted under my feet. Another section of ceiling began descending. Then another.

[ANNOTATION: Action cascade. Short sentences. Physical sensation grounded.]

The exit door was visible. Ten feet away. The ceiling was six feet from the water and dropping. I had maybe thirty seconds.

[ANNOTATION: Countdown to climax. Specific numbers create tension.]

I triggered Sprint, burning through the last of my Stamina, and launched myself toward the door.

The ceiling touched water three steps before I reached safety. I felt the pressure wave as the chamber compressed, the displaced water shoving me through the doorway like the dungeon itself was spitting me out.

[ANNOTATION: Skill used decisively. Sensory description of near-miss. "Spitting me out" personifies dungeon's adversarial nature.]

I landed in chamber three. The door slammed shut behind me. Water sprayed through the seams for a moment, then stopped.

[ANNOTATION: Safety achieved. Environmental detail confirms the close call.]

Chamber three was empty. A rest room. The exit portal glowed at the far end.

I lay on the floor, water draining from my clothes, Stamina bar completely empty, and laughed. It wasn't a happy laugh. More the laugh of someone whose nervous system had been taking notes on everything that could have gone wrong.

[ANNOTATION: Emotional release through dark laughter. Physical state described. Resource drain noted.]

[Challenge Complete: The Drowning Halls]
[Time Bonus: None (completed with 0.3 seconds remaining)]
[Comment: Cutting it close. The audience appreciates dramatic timing.]

Zero point three seconds. The System had nearly killed me and was complimenting my entertainment value.

I got up, walked to the exit portal, and made a mental note to never enter a dungeon with "drowning" in the name again.

[ANNOTATION: System commentary adds gallows humor. Protagonist's response is practical resolution. Ends on character voice.]

## Dialogue Scene Templates

### Example 1: Tense Negotiation (~450 words)

---

The Kindari broker's wings flickered in patterns my translation implant labeled as [CAUTIOUS INTEREST / EVALUATING]. Moths the size of German Shepherds made surprisingly effective negotiators, possibly because their compound eyes made it impossible to tell if they were looking at you or past you.

"You request extraction assistance," it said. "For a human contestant. Level 12."

"I request a price quote for extraction assistance. There's a difference."

More wing-flickering. [MILD AMUSEMENT]. "Your species negotiates poorly. You reveal intent through your muscle-configurations."

"We call those expressions. They're an involuntary feature."

"An involuntary vulnerability, we would say."

I leaned back in the chair—carefully, because alien furniture had different assumptions about spine geometry. "Let's assume I'm terrible at negotiating and you're going to exploit that. What's the baseline price for getting one human out of a mid-tier dungeon before they die?"

The Kindari's antennae twitched. [RECALCULATING]. It hadn't expected directness.

"Twelve thousand Attention Units. Plus operational costs."

"For that price, I could sponsor three new contestants and hope one survives."

"Yes. But those would not be *this* contestant. Humans are sentimental about specific individuals. Your species' weakness is also your market value."

Accurate. Brutal. Probably fair.

"Eight thousand," I said. "The operational costs are your problem."

"Fourteen thousand. I have added a fee for the insult of your counter-offer."

"Nine thousand, and I mention your operation favorably to the Liberation Collective observers I'm meeting next cycle."

The wings went still. Completely still. In Kindari body language, that meant either [EXTREME INTEREST] or [CONSIDERING VIOLENCE].

"You have meetings with the Liberation Collective."

"I have access to their information networks. Whether that translates to meetings depends on how this negotiation concludes."

Silence stretched. Compound eyes reflected the chamber's lighting in patterns that might have been thoughtful or might have been nothing at all.

"Ten thousand," the Kindari said finally. "And you tell me what the Liberation Collective is planning in the Sol System market."

"I don't know what they're planning. But I'll tell you what they're worried about, which is usually more useful."

More wing movement. [AGREEMENT / GRUDGING RESPECT].

"You negotiate better than most humans."

"I learn from pattern recognition. Your tells are more consistent than you think."

It was a bluff. I had no idea what its tells meant. But confidence was a negotiation tool too, and sometimes the best play was looking like you knew more than you did.

The Kindari extended a limb. I shook it, trying not to think about how many joints it had.

Deal made.

### Example 2: Comedic Banter (~400 words)

---

"You're holding the sword wrong," Mei said.

"I'm holding it the way that keeps me alive."

"Those aren't the same thing. Watch." She demonstrated a grip adjustment that looked marginally different from what I'd been doing. "This gives you better edge alignment."

"My edge alignment has been fine."

"Your edge alignment got you stabbed twice yesterday."

"Those were unrelated to edge alignment. Those were related to being outnumbered and also not a sword person."

Mei sighed. It was a specific sigh, one I'd learned to recognize over the past week. The "why did I agree to mentor this person" sigh. "What were you before the System? No—let me guess. Something with computers."

"Software engineer. Robotics startup."

"Ah." She nodded like that explained everything. "You think about fighting like debugging. Find the error, fix it, problem solved."

"That's... not wrong."

"It's not right either. Combat isn't logical. It's dynamic. The enemy isn't a bug—they're adapting to you while you're adapting to them. You need to stop thinking about optimal solutions and start thinking about *probable* situations."

I considered this. "That sounds like predictive modeling."

"Call it whatever you want. Just do it while holding the sword correctly."

I adjusted my grip. It felt wrong. It would probably feel wrong until muscle memory overwrote my current bad habits.

"Why do you care?" I asked. "We're not in an alliance. My survival doesn't benefit you."

Mei's expression shifted—something that wasn't quite a smile but wasn't quite not one. "You figured out the reflection trick against that Prismatic Wraith. No one else in our cohort even came close. If you die because you hold a sword like a club, that's wasted potential."

"So this is investment."

"This is me not wanting to watch an interesting person die stupidly. Don't read too much into it."

"I wasn't going to."

"Good." She picked up her own sword. "Again. And this time, try to look like you've held a weapon before."

"I have held weapons before. Soldering irons. Very dangerous in the wrong hands."

The corner of her mouth twitched. Not quite a laugh. Progress.

---

### Example 3: Emotional Revelation (~400 words)

---

The safe room was quiet. Just me, the walls, and the persistent hum of whatever kept the dungeon atmosphere breathable.

Mei hadn't made it.

I'd seen her take the hit. Watched the light go out of her eyes before she hit the floor. The System had recycled her drops before I could reach her—cold efficiency, maximizing entertainment value for the next contestant who'd find useful loot where a person had been.

I sat against the wall and didn't cry. Not because I was strong. Because the tears wouldn't come.

The grief was there, somewhere. I could feel it pressing against the edges of whatever mental compartment I'd shoved it into. But the compartment held. It had to hold. The dungeon wasn't going to pause for my emotional processing.

"This is bullshit," I said to the empty room.

No response. The System didn't comment on grief. Apparently human misery wasn't worth engagement points.

My hand found the item she'd given me two days ago—a training manual she'd found in a loot drop. "For your edge alignment," she'd said. "Try not to die before you read it."

I opened it. Her handwriting filled the margins. Notes, corrections, observations. Things she'd noticed about my fighting style. Suggestions for improvement.

She'd been planning to teach me more. She'd invested in my survival even when she'd pretended not to.

And now she was gone, and the manual was all that remained of that investment.

I closed my eyes. Took a breath. Let the grief press against its compartment walls for a moment before shoving it back.

Later. I'd deal with it later. When I wasn't still inside the place that killed her.

[System Notification: Emotional Resonance detected. Viewer engagement metrics elevated. Note: This is not mockery. Your species' capacity for loss-processing generates significant entertainment value. The System records this as observational data only.]

"Thanks for that," I said. "Really helpful."

The notification faded. The dungeon hummed.

I stood up, tucked the manual into my inventory, and walked toward the exit. The grief walked with me, still contained, still waiting.

There would be time for it later. There was always supposed to be time later.

## Exposition Delivery Templates

### Example 1: Learning Game Mechanics

---

[New Skill Available: Mana Shield (Active)]
[Cost: 15 MP/second while active]
[Effect: Creates a barrier that absorbs incoming damage equal to your Intelligence x 10]
[Requirements: Intelligence 20+, Level 8+]
[Accept? Y/N]

I stared at the notification. Mana Shield. My first proper defensive skill, if I chose to take it.

The math was interesting. My Intelligence was currently 24, which meant the shield would absorb 240 damage before breaking. That sounded useful until I checked my mana pool—450 MP total, which meant I could sustain the shield for thirty seconds at full drain.

Thirty seconds of invulnerability, basically. Except not invulnerability, because the shield had a damage cap, and some of the things I'd been fighting dealt damage in the hundreds per hit.

So more like "thirty seconds of not dying to small and medium attacks, after which I'd be defenseless and mana-depleted."

Still better than the nothing I currently had.

But there was another option in my skill list: Resonant Strike (Enhanced), an upgrade to my existing damage skill that would increase the stacking bonus from 7% to 15%.

Offense versus defense. The eternal character build dilemma.

The smart play was probably defense. I'd nearly died six times in the last dungeon, and "nearly" was doing a lot of work in that sentence. A shield would have saved me at least twice.

But defense only prolonged fights. And longer fights meant more chances for things to go wrong.

I thought about Mei's advice: "Stop thinking about optimal. Think about probable."

What was more probable: death from damage I couldn't absorb, or death from fights that lasted too long?

The dungeon I was heading into was rumored to have swarm enemies. Lots of small attacks rather than big hits.

Defense it was.

[Skill Acquired: Mana Shield]

---

### Example 2: Faction History Reveal

---

The Quorathi archivist floated in its containment sphere, tentacles arranged in what my translation implant suggested was [PEDAGOGICAL POSTURE]. It had been explaining galactic history for twenty minutes, and I was only now starting to understand how badly humans had been screwed.

"The Consortium formed to prevent war," it said. "This is true. But the nature of that war is often... misrepresented."

"Misrepresented how?"

"The founder species were not threatened by external enemies. They were threatened by themselves. By ennui. Civilizations that persist for millions of cycles do not struggle with resources or territory. They struggle with meaning."

I thought about that. Immortal species getting bored. It sounded almost sympathetic until you remembered what they'd done about it.

"So they created the games."

"They created entertainment. The games are merely the most successful format." The Quorathi's tentacles shifted. [DISCOMFORT / HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE]. "Early formats were less... organized. Entire species were harvested and exterminated for single events. The Consortium introduced rules. Standards. The appearance of fairness."

"The appearance."

"Yes. The games are fairer than what came before. This does not make them fair."

I filed that away. The Consortium as the lesser evil—still evil, but systematized evil. Bureaucratic horror rather than random horror.

"Why are you telling me this?"

The Quorathi's sphere rotated slightly. [CALCULATING / DECIDING]. "Because human contestants who understand the system survive longer. And Quorathi find humans... interesting. Your species processes information differently than most. You see patterns where others see noise."

"And you want to see what patterns I find."

"We want to observe what you do with understanding. Whether you accept the system's constraints or attempt to subvert them." Tentacles rippled. [ANTICIPATION]. "Most species accept. Humans have a statistical anomaly toward subversion."

Great. I was a research subject for jellyfish academics studying human resistance to cosmic oppression.

Though that was probably better than being research subjects for extinction.

"Thanks for the history lesson," I said. "Any other cheery revelations about my species' place in the galactic hierarchy?"

"Several. But you appear to have reached your information absorption limit." [MILD AMUSEMENT]. "We will continue another time. If you survive."

If I survive. Everyone kept saying that.

---

### Example 3: Character Backstory

---

"The startup," Mei said, "tell me about it."

We were waiting for a dungeon portal to stabilize. Downtime. The rare kind where nothing was trying to kill us.

"Why do you care?"

"Because you keep referencing it. 'Like a deployment going wrong.' 'Like a code review from hell.' Your entire mental framework comes from that job. I want to understand it."

I leaned against the staging area wall. "It was a robotics company. Industrial automation. We were building systems that could operate in environments too dangerous for humans."

"And you liked this work?"

"I loved it." The words came out before I could filter them. Honest. Uncomfortable. "It was... building things that solved real problems. Physical problems. Not just shuffling data between services."

Mei waited. She was good at waiting.

"The company was struggling when I left. Funding issues. My wife—ex-wife—thought I should find something more stable. She wasn't wrong. But leaving felt like quitting."

"Did she leave because you stayed?"

"She left because I was bad at being present. The job was an excuse, but it wasn't the reason." I looked at the unstable portal, watching reality flicker. "I spent so much time thinking about systems and optimization that I forgot relationships weren't problems to solve."

"And now you're here."

"Now I'm here. Solving problems. Optimizing survival. Treating a cosmic entertainment nightmare like a codebase that needs debugging."

Mei was quiet for a moment. "Maybe that's not wrong."

"What do you mean?"

"The humans who treat this like a game die. They make choices based on what would be fun, what would be dramatic. But the humans who treat it like work—who approach it systematically—they last longer." She met my eyes. "You're broken in a way that helps you survive here."

I thought about that. Broken. She wasn't wrong either.

"Thanks," I said. "I think."

"The portal's stabilizing." She pushed off from her wall. "Ready to go back to work?"

I checked my gear. Weapons. Items. The familiar pre-deployment checklist.

"Ready."

## System Interface Format

### Visual Formatting

System messages appear as distinct text blocks in the narrative. Format as:

```
[System Notification Title]
[Content here—stats, descriptions, updates]
[Optional: System commentary in italics or marked with "Note:"]
```

**Example**:
```
[Level Up! You are now Level 12!]
[Stat Points Available: 5]
[New Skill Slot Unlocked!]
[Note: Finally. The audience was getting concerned about your progression rate.]
```

### When to Show Full Stats vs. Summarize

**Show full stats**:
- Major level-ups
- New skill acquisitions
- First encounter with new enemy types
- When the protagonist is actively analyzing their build

**Summarize stats**:
- Routine combat (mention skill names, not full effects)
- Quick reference during action (just the number that matters)
- Repeated encounters (readers already know the stats)

**Example of summary**:
> My Mana Shield took three hits before cracking. I had maybe one more activation before I'd be running on empty.

### Protagonist Reaction to Notifications

The protagonist treats System notifications like pop-up windows: sometimes useful, often sarcastic, always processed through his engineering mindset.

**Typical reactions**:
- Dry commentary on the information provided
- Technical analysis of what the numbers mean
- Dark humor about implications
- Brief acknowledgment during combat (no time for extended reflection)

**Example**:
> [Warning: Stamina Critical (12%)]
>
> Yes, thank you, I was aware of being exhausted. The burning lungs and shaking legs had clued me in.

### Balancing Crunch with Narrative Flow

**Rule**: No stat block should last more than 5-6 lines. If more information is needed, spread it across multiple notifications or have the protagonist summarize.

**Rule**: Every stat display should earn its space. If the numbers don't matter for what happens next, summarize instead.

**Rule**: System commentary should be rare. When it appears, it should reveal something about the System's nature or add genuine humor.
