# LitRPG Universe Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Action-Comedy Tone (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The series MUST maintain an action-comedy tone throughout all novels.

- Violence is exciting and consequential but played for entertainment value
- Stakes are real without dwelling on trauma or grimdark elements
- Humor is witty banter, absurd situations, and irreverent commentary
- Emotional moments are earned but light-touch—bonds matter, losses sting, fun prevails
- Crude humor and profanity are balanced with clever wit; never mean-spirited

**Rationale**: Tone consistency across a multi-novel series is the foundation of reader trust. Tonal whiplash breaks immersion and damages series commitment.

### II. Character Voice Consistency

The protagonist MUST have a distinctive, consistent voice across all content.

- Profane, sarcastic, and self-deprecating internal monologue
- Dark humor as primary coping mechanism
- Voice evolves in sophistication but core personality remains recognizable
- Supporting characters MUST have differentiated voices that don't blur together

**Rationale**: Voice is the reader's constant companion. Inconsistent voice signals different authors or careless writing.

### III. Protagonist Identity

The protagonist is a contemporary Earth human man with specific defined traits.

- Software Engineering and Robotics background (pattern recognition, systems thinking)
- Technical problem-solving enables exploitation of game mechanics others miss
- Relatable flaws balanced with deeply buried competence
- Clear moral line that creates meaningful ethical dilemmas

**Rationale**: A well-defined protagonist enables authentic authorial voice and consistent decision-making across 5+ novels.

### IV. World Structure: Standalone Dungeons

Each novel MUST feature a separate standalone dungeon with its own identity.

- One primary dungeon per novel (no mega-dungeon spanning books)
- Each dungeon has unique themes, monsters, rules, and challenges
- Difficulty escalates across the series, not within a single structure
- Fresh settings prevent reader fatigue and enable varied storytelling

**Rationale**: Standalone dungeons allow each book to feel complete while maintaining series momentum.

### V. Game Mechanics Integrity

The LitRPG system MUST be internally consistent and trackable.

- Stats, levels, classes, skills, and inventory MUST be logical and memorable
- Progression feels earned—no deus ex machina power-ups without setup and cost
- Mechanics create meaningful choices; different builds enable different strategies
- Rules established early MUST constrain later developments (no retcons)
- Readers who care about builds can theorize; readers who don't can skim safely

**Rationale**: Mechanical consistency is the core contract with LitRPG readers. Breaking it destroys trust.

### VI. Plot Architecture

Series plot follows a defined escalation arc with per-novel completeness.

- Each novel: complete dungeon arc with resolution PLUS series-advancing revelation
- Stakes escalate: personal survival → faction involvement → universe-altering consequences
- Series builds toward confrontation with the System itself
- Cliffhangers satisfy immediate needs while demanding sequels

**Rationale**: Multi-novel commitment requires each book to deliver value while maintaining series addiction.

### VII. Authenticity Over Trend-Chasing

Write from genuine creative vision, not market-chasing.

- Author's lived experience informs protagonist authenticity
- Choices that feel true to character > choices that seem "optimal" for market
- Subvert genre expectations only when it serves the story, not for shock value
- Community feedback informs but doesn't dictate creative direction

**Rationale**: Readers detect inauthenticity. Sustainable series come from genuine creative investment.

## Creative Standards

### Voice & Style Requirements

- **Prose**: Bold, punchy, readable—short sentences in action, longer in reflection
- **Dialogue**: Profanity and crude humor when character-appropriate
- **Exposition**: Delivered through character discovery, not info-dumps
- **Pacing**: Action setpieces balanced with character beats and comedic relief

### World-Building Standards

- **Consistency**: Universe rules established in Book 1 bind all subsequent books
- **Mystery Budget**: Early mysteries MUST pay off; don't create questions without planned answers
- **Faction Complexity**: No pure good/evil; all factions have comprehensible motivations
- **Scale**: Galactic entertainment system with clear economics and cultural logic

### Character Standards

- **Supporting Cast**: Own goals, backstories, and arcs independent of protagonist
- **Relationships**: Complex alliances—allies may betray, enemies may convert
- **Non-Human Companion**: At least one provides universe perspective and emotional anchor
- **Losses**: Significant departures/deaths handled with action-comedy tone; impact without wallowing

## Development Workflow

### Planning Phase

1. Universe bible defines constraints before writing begins
2. Per-novel outline approved before prose drafting
3. Character decisions checked against constitution principles
4. Mechanical implications reviewed for consistency

### Writing Phase

1. Draft chapters maintain voice consistency (use voice checklist)
2. Game mechanics cross-referenced against established rules
3. Tone deviations flagged for review
4. Per-chapter pacing audit (action/character/comedy balance)

### Review Phase

1. Beta readers assess tone consistency and entertainment value
2. Mechanics audit ensures no rule violations
3. Voice consistency check across POV sections
4. Cliffhanger/resolution balance evaluated per novel

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other creative guidance for the LitRPG Universe project.

**Amendment Process**:
1. Proposed changes documented with rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing content required
3. Version increment follows semantic rules (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH)
4. Migration plan for existing content if principles change

**Compliance**:
- All planning documents MUST verify alignment with constitution
- Spec clarifications MUST NOT contradict established principles
- Plot decisions that violate principles require explicit justification and potential amendment

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-17 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-17
