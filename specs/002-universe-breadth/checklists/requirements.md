# Specification Quality Checklist: Universe Breadth Expansion

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- 6 user stories cover all identified expansion areas
- 14 functional requirements provide clear deliverables (expanded for ~100 species scope)
- 10 success criteria enable measurable validation
- Species scope expanded to ~100 with tiered detail system (Tier 1: detailed, Tier 2: standard, Tier 3: brief)
- All 12 founder species required at Tier 1 detail
- D&D-inspired archetypes adapted to sci-fi context
- Humans documented as species from galactic perspective

## Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | Spec focuses on authoring needs, not implementation |
| Requirement Completeness | PASS | All requirements testable, no ambiguity |
| Feature Readiness | PASS | Ready for planning phase |

**Overall Status**: READY FOR PLANNING
