# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Novel LitRPG Universe

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Pass Summary

All 16 checklist items pass validation.

**Content Quality**: Spec focuses on WHAT (reader experience, story elements, emotional beats) not HOW (no technical implementation details). Written for a creative project but maintains stakeholder clarity.

**Requirements**: 40 functional requirements cover all requested areas:
- Universe & World-Building (FR-001 through FR-005)
- Lifeforms & Species (FR-006 through FR-009)
- Factions & Power Structures (FR-010 through FR-013)
- Main Character (FR-014 through FR-018)
- Supporting Characters (FR-019 through FR-022)
- Backstory & Setup (FR-023 through FR-025)
- Plot Structure (FR-026 through FR-030)
- Game Mechanics (FR-031 through FR-035)
- Writing Style (FR-036 through FR-040)

**Success Criteria**: All 10 criteria are measurable and user-focused (reader completion rates, emotional impact surveys, community engagement metrics, rating averages).

**Edge Cases**: Three key edge cases identified with solutions.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers—all decisions documented in Assumptions
- This is a creative writing project; requirements adapted to narrative deliverables rather than software features
