### 2. tone-guide.md

**Content Requirements**:

#### Action-Comedy Balance

**The Formula**:
- 70% action/plot progression
- 20% comedy (integrated, not isolated)
- 10% character/emotional beats

**What Action-Comedy Means**:
- [ ] Comedy enhances action, doesn't interrupt it
- [ ] Stakes are real, consequences matter
- [ ] Humor is character-appropriate, not author-inserted
- [ ] Deaths are quick and impactful, not lingered upon
- [ ] Victories are satisfying, not undermined by jokes

**Tone Calibration Examples**:

| Situation | Wrong Tone | Right Tone |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Ally death | Extended mourning | Brief gut-punch, then keep moving |
| Victory | Triumphant speech | Exhausted quip + quiet moment |
| Danger | Panic narration | Controlled assessment + dark humor |
| Romance (if any) | Sappy confession | Awkward banter + earned moment |

#### Violence Treatment

**DO**:
- [ ] Describe combat in tactical terms
- [ ] Show consequences (injuries matter)
- [ ] Use violence to reveal character
- [ ] Make monster deaths more graphic than human deaths

**DON'T**:
- [ ] Linger on suffering
- [ ] Describe gore for shock value
- [ ] Make violence the joke (slapstick death)
- [ ] Sanitize consequences (no injuries?)

**Word Count**: 1,500-2,500 words
